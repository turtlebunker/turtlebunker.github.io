        </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our next meeting will be held
      on Saturday, October 19th  from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge
      Road.  Exit I-5 (north or south) and go EAST for a few blocks.
        This is one of our most important meetings &#150; pre-hibernation.
       Feel free to bring your pets for a free checkup.  You can let
      others admire your turtles, but please keep them in a box.  Diseases
      are easily spread and the stress of the event can bring on a
      runny nose.   Turtles and tortoises are completely aware of what
      is going on at all times and are uneasy when taken out of their
      normal surroundings.   Father Dimitri will be on hand to help
      and add his expert advice and insight and I will be there to
      add my feminine point of view.  You will find out that there
      are many ways to keep a tortoise healthy.  The three rules to
      remember are:  proper food, proper peaceful environment and protection
      from predators and that includes family pets and children.  
      Richard Spekner said he would try to come to the meeting and
      give another talk about exotic water turtles.  Let&#146;s hope
      he can make it.  He runs a very busy pet shop in Antioch called
      Pet&#146;acular  1-925-755-HERP. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our TURTLERAMA was the best ever.
       I believe it was because half of it was held outside.  The trees
      have grown considerably and gave us a beautiful shady area to
      set up pens and keep the turtles and tortoises out of the air-conditioned
      meeting room.  There was more room indoors for our displays and
      demonstrations and literature and the visitors were not crowded
      together as they have been in the past.  We had a great selection
      of chelonians for people to look at.  Thank you to Bobbi, Liz,
      Denise, Craig, Sharon, Fritz, Suzanne, Nadine and her friend,
      Hidde, Jennifer, Joy, Father Dimitri, Shirley, Lew and the Sadler
      family.  Special thanks to Linda, my &#145;bodyguard&#146; who
      also did a great job with the mop and broom after the show was
      over and to Kathie who drove all the way from Alabama to bring
      Ninja, her huge Sulcata, to the Turtlerama.   Please excuse me
      if I&#146;ve omitted anyone.  Let me know and I&#146;ll include
      you in the next newsletter.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We have been invited to participate
      in the annual Pet Expo at Cal Expo.  I couldn&#146;t do it this
      year due to being asked at the last minute.   If we want to be
      included next year, I&#146;ll need a gang of helpers since it
      is a three-day event.  We can display critters and sell stuff,
      but do we really want to?   Isn&#146;t the Turtlerama enough
      exposure?  Let&#146;s talk about it.  <BR>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Not sure whether the snails you feed
      your turtles have ingested pesticides?  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Put your collected snails into
      a gallon ice cream bucket with a snap lid.  Punch holes in the
      lid.  Cover the bottom of the bucket with corn meal.  Put a small
      margarine container or mealworm container of water in the middle
      of the corn meal and seal the snails in the bucket.  Leave for
      four days.  The snails&#146; feces will be yellow and any impurities
      in their bodies will have been purged and you can feed them to
      your turtles.  Or put the snails into a smaller sealable container
      and freeze;  they will pull into their shells as they die.  Store
      them up to a year.  Excellent when thawed and offered as winter
      food when fresh snails are not available.   <I> <B>(reprinted

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After you&#146;re gone&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;I&#146;ve
      been mentioning at our last few meetings, the importance of leaving
      instructions regarding your pets in case you suddenly are not
      there anymore.  Several of our club members have died this year.
       Most recently it was Virginia Boggs.  She had been a member
      since 1983.  When I saw the obituary I said to Bill, &#147;Here
      comes Wallis&#148; and sure enough, a few days later, Virginia&#146;s
      husband was at my door holding Wallis, the box turtle.  I am
      sure Virginia would have wanted me to care for Wallis, but then,
      who really knows?  For starters, take photos of your pets right
      now and put them on 3X5 cards and write down the pet&#146;s name
      and what it eats.  That will help if there is an immediate problem.
       Then write down what you would like to have happen to your pets
      in the future.  There&#146;s a great article about this topic
      in the July 2002 issue of the World Chelonian Trust newsletter
      mentioned above.  Unlike cats and dogs, turtles and tortoises
      often outlive us.  Please do your best to see that they continue
      to be cared for correctly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It has been an extraordinary
      summer, with more turtles and tortoises attending summer camp
      than ever before.  Some have come here for extended stays due
      to family problems and I have labeled them and the fun begins
      when their label falls off.  I do have separate areas in the
      yard for various species but when the temperature soars, they
      all go into high gear and start pushing, climbing on one another
      in a frenzy to go where they don&#146;t belong.  For example,
      one hot day, I went out to feed the water turtles and was shocked
      by what I saw.  It was a male Russian tortoise swimming with
      the water turtles.  Tortoises can&#146;t swim!  They sink to
      the bottom and drown.  This guy was swimming and not for fun.
       He was trying to stay alive and I know he was happy to be out
      of what could have been his watery grave.  He had probably just
      fallen in a moment earlier or was pushed in because tortoises
      don&#146;t normally enter the water.  He needed supportive care
      for two weeks and I won&#146;t let him hibernate.  He managed
      to get to the pond by climbing over a bunch of tall bricks meant
      to keep him and his buddies out of the pond area. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Speedy, the tortoise with the
      sprained or broken leg which I fixed using panty-hose was returned
      to The Bunker because at home, he refused to eat and was lethargic.
       After placing him with the other tortoises, an immediate transformation
      took place.  His head began bobbing, he became completely alert
      and his full appetite returned.  I guess he missed his friends
      and was no longer content to be an &#145;only tortoise&#146;&#133;&#133;&#133;..
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim the Jackass has been
      secluded in the Greenhouse since the Turtlerama when he terrorized
      a club members&#146; Sulcata and Leopard tortoises she had put
      into the pen with him, not realizing what he was like.  Just
      Jim Junior keeps hammering away on other tortoises of any species,
      except his own kind.   My neighbors think I am constantly repairing
      the fences.  There is a third male Greek, Just Jim the Jerk,
      who is learning from the others to create havoc in the yard.
       He looks bad, all lumpy with his shell pushed in on one side,
      running about the yard with his head held up high, looking for
      his next victim.  I love these feisty guys.  Tortoises with attitude!
       They do spend most of the summer in the Greenhouse, however,
      to spare the others and themselves.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The other night, Bill (non-turtle-loving-husband)
      came downstairs to tell me an egg had exploded in the incubator
      near his computer.  He was sitting quietly working when he suddenly
      heard a loud pop followed by a foul odor.  He thought something
      electrical had blown but didn&#146;t see anything &#150; and
      then he remembered what was in the room with him.  I took the
      incubator into the garage and cleaned up the mess (Angie, it
      was one of your eggs) and returned the rest to the incubator.
       That smell is unforgettable. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ty the snapping turtle is still
      here.  A club member felt so sorry for him that she bought him
      a pool of his own. Thank You Sonia!!  Surprisingly, he cannot
      climb out of it, however, it is a little more difficult to keep
      clean than the garbage pail was, but he has more room to move
      about.  I am hoping that he will be able to leave California
      before too long.  There is a hint that he may become part of
      a reptile exhibit at Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo.  Keep
      your fingers crossed.  Then we can visit him from time to time.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">While I was writing this column,
      I went outside to check on the critters and spotted a deep hole
      in the corner of the yard.  Darn.  Fat Betty did it again!! 
      She is at the bottom of the hole.  I got flat down on the ground
      and stuck my arm all the way inside and even tho I can touch
      her shell, I can&#146;t pull her out.  She has wedged herself
      in tight.  Now I am filthy AND mad!!   I dug out some of the
      dirt to try to get to her but it didn&#146;t work.  I don&#146;t
      want the other tortoises joining her &#150; so I&#146;ve put
      a screen loosely over the top and can only hope she comes up
      when I&#146;m around so I can encourage her to hibernate in a
      safer place.  I can&#146;t imagine her surviving in that deep
      hole when it rains, however, she goes &#145;somewhere&#146; every
      winter and comes out ok.  I hope I&#146;ll have good news to
      report in the next newsletter.  Since she is our meteorologist,
      perhaps we are in for a long cold winter?  After all, it&#146;s
      100 degrees outside.  Why is she underground now? </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Two more tortoises have been
      found using the &#147;Look Northeast&#148; method.  Keep this
      in mind if any of your pets climb out when you&#146;re not looking.
       One of the tortoises, Katey, a Russian, had climbed out of her
      pen, gone to the northeast corner of the yard, spotted a tiny
      hole, got out through the hole and into the neighbors yard and
      continued on to the northeast corner of the neighbors yard. 
      I&#146;m glad the owner emailed me about the escapee so I could
      help her find it.  It sure is a good feeling when you find your
      pet again.  </FONT></P>
