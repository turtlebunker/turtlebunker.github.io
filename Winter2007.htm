      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our next meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, January 19th</B> from 1 until 3 (approximately)
      at the Belle Cooledge Library located on the corner of Fruitridge
      Road and South Land Park Drive.  Bad weather will cancel the
      meeting so call ahead if in doubt (421-1134).  We can discuss
      your problems at this time of the year and with the icy weather,
      I'm sure most of you are worried about your turtles hibernating
      outside.  If you are too embarrassed to ask your questions, please
      write them on a piece of paper and give them to me, anonymously
      is fine.  We'll try to give you our very best answer.  Remember,
      there are many ways to keep turtles and tortoises in captivity
      and one way isn't necessarily better than another.  If there
      aren't many questions or much to talk about at this 'Slumberama',
      we can watch a related DVD or two if you like or we can simply
      munch and mingle and do a lot of turtle talk.  At the end, we'll
      have our raffle.  Thanks to all who donate wonderful items each
      time.  What would I do without you?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was very crowded
      and fun.  Thanks to all who helped clean up afterwards!  We really
      appreciated your assistance.  Father Dimitri conducted quite
      a few pre-hibernation checkups and gave advice as to who should
      or shouldn't be allowed to hibernate.  We never know what winter
      will bring,  and here in Sacramento, we know how very cold the
      nights can be without any cloud cover.  When it is raining, it
      is definitely warmer.  In any event, around Valentine's Day,
      you should begin seeing some turtles coming to life in your yard.
       No need to feed them until the weather stabilizes and they appear
      to be looking for food such as sniffing the ground or following
      you around. For now, however, your job is to plan on how to make
      your yard a better place for your pets in 2008.</FONT></P>

      ELIMINATE HAZARDS IN YOUR YARD</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Make your yard escape-proof for
      your pets.  Some type of fencing is necessary.  Never tether
      a tortoise!!  If you have board or wire fencing, you will need
      to sink lumber or wire several inches below ground level to discourage
      tunneling out.  Occasionally a tortoise may attempt to tunnel
      even under block wall fencing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the tortoise can see through
      at the base of the fence, the natural interest in 'getting over
      there' may lead to constant pacing, frustration, fence climbing
      and injury.  A permanent, continuous 18-24&quot; high baseboard
      that obstructs the view should relieve this problem.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In addition to latching the gate
      when not in use, you should install a permanent 18&quot; high
      barrier across the base of the gate opening.  This will prevent
      escapes during your use of the gate or if the gate is accidentally
      left ajar.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tortoises often fall into swimming
      pools and ponds and drown due to poor depth perception.  They
      also enjoy climbing but may become caught in obstacles or tipped
      over.  Specific hazards include steps, irregularly stacked wood,
      parked cycles and power equipment, especially when stored on
      a concrete slab.  A tortoise that falls on its back and is unable
      to right itself can die of suffocation or become fatally overheated
      in the sunshine before you find it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another danger is the family
      dog, usually curious, sometimes jealous, aggressive or just playful.
       Any kind of constant harassment can be injurious to a tortoise's
      health.  For this reason, a tortoise is not recommended for households
      in which the normal manipulative behavior of children cannot
      be directed away from the tortoise.  One must be willing to enjoy
      watching how the tortoise spends its day, rather than having
      to carry the tortoise about.  A tortoise should be held in the
      same position as it stands.  Its shell may break if the animal
      is dropped, with dire consequences.   BE ALERT!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's been quite stressful this
      winter due to raccoon visitors.  Not one, not two, but THREE
      of them have been coming into the yard looking for something
      to eat and if it weren't for the Driveway Patrol alerting me,
      the carnage would be complete.  So far, no harm has been done,
      except of course, to my sleep.  I cannot stress the importance
      of having an alarm set up in your back yard where your turtles
      and tortoises are sleeping.  We have to do all we can to protect
      our pets from a cruel and untimely death.  By the way, if you
      order the alarms from our website, it benefits the club.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Half of the box turtles are still
      awake in mid-December but not eating which is not unusual for
      them, however, a few Greek tortoises refuse to sleep and will
      eat if I put food in front of them.  The Russians, including
      Fat Betty, have finally gone into hibernation.   Blondie and
      her friends in the Greenhouse are snug and warm.  A new Leopard
      tortoise has come into the Bunker.  She is totally deformed,
      obviously she was an apartment tortoise.  Her shell is pyramided
      causing most of her body to bulge out all around.  She did live
      in an aquarium for the last 6 or 7 years and ate bok choy and
      arrived here with two containers: Rep-Cal Calcium with Vitamin
      D and Rep-Cal Herptivite (multivitamins).  Both containers were
      less than half full and it seems to me that the cramped aquarium
      life, keeping her from having any space to walk or exercise,
      along with these vitamins, probably caused the terrible deformity.
       I'm sure a Vita-Lite was involved as well, probably too close
      to her shell and on way too many hours a day making the deformities
      even worse.  I'm afraid this is permanent.  I've never seen a
      tortoise outgrow it.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And that's it from The Bunker.
       Everyone is behaving right now but we know it won't last too
      long!!</FONT></P>

      OVERCROWDING</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Overcrowding of turtles and tortoises
      brings on many changes in behavior and health.  Some symptoms
      are obvious but others may be very subtle because turtles and
      tortoises sure know how to keep secrets.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the wild, tortoises have plenty
      of room to roam altho they don't travel too far from their home
      base.  There is territorial head bobbing going on but not on
      a daily basis as happens in a back yard situation.  Being allowed
      to fight every day does shorten a tortoise's life.  And, as far
      as the female tortoises are concerned, being chased, bitten and
      rammed nearly every waking hour leads to depression, sickness
      and death.  One male desert tortoise in an ordinary sized back
      yard is enough.  Two or more females is acceptable because they
      are non-aggressive, altho there are some exceptions to the rule!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Water turtles will bite each
      others tails off (and worse) if they are too crowded in one pool.
       Some of the turtles will bob around like a cork with all of
      their limbs tucked inside to protect themselves from the aggressive
      ones.   The bad boys should be housed in a much larger pond.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Box turtles show their overcrowding
      stress by bickering with one another, biting, not coming out
      to bask and one of the most obvious clues is laying eggs on top
      of the soil.  This is not a normal activity unless the eggs are
      infertile or the turtle is not pleased with its surroundings.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Try to limit yourself to:  Desert
      tortoises (and other tortoises) 1 male, 2 females.  Box turtles:
      2 males and 5 or more females would be a good ratio.  This way,
      one female won't be chased constantly by the males.  Water turtles:
       1 male to 2 or 3 females if kept in a small wading pool.  Larger
      ponds can accommodate a larger number of turtles.   I know it's
      difficult to limit oneself, but it is so much better for the
      turtles and tortoises to live hassle free.  For those who must
      have them all, section off the yard and make sure the tortoises
      cannot see into the other pens.  Out of sight, out of mind!!
       Hope you had a very Happy Holiday Season.  Thanks a million
      for all of your cards and DUES PLUS!!!!   xoxoxoxoxo</FONT>
