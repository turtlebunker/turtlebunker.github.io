      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our FALL meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, October 18th</B> from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle
      Cooledge Library located on the corner of South Land Park and
      Fruitridge Road. From I-5, north or south, go EAST on Fruitridge
      Road. I&#146;ve got a special surprise for all of you. Kathie
      Harine has said she will drive here from her home in Alabama
      and bring Ninja, the Sulcata, to the meeting and talk about him.
      Kathie has had Ninja for many years and I believe he weighed
      about 12 pounds when she got him and he is now a hefty 65-70
      pounds or more. Kathie is planning to move back to our area and
      we&#146;ll be happy to have her and her assorted turtles and
      tortoises close by again.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There will be lots to talk about
      at the meeting including pre-hibernation problems, hatchling
      care and how to care for sick turtles over the winter months.
      Also, some of you prefer not to let your turtles and tortoises
      hibernate and we can give you some advice about that as well.
      Feel free to bring your pet for a casual checkup but if it is
      already hibernating, please do not wake it up. And don&#146;t
      pass the turtles around the room, ok?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Fall meeting is also our
      <B>Pot Luck</B> meeting so bring your favorite dish, dips, chips,
      cookies, cake, whatever you like and the club will supply the
      coffee, tea and soft drinks and turtle chocolates. I&#146;d also
      like to have a Halloween contest. Dress your turtle up in a spooky
      costume and try to win a prize. Let me know if you want to be
      a judge. And speaking of prizes, we can always use QUALITY items
      for our raffle. Look through your treasures and perhaps you have
      doubles or items you no longer want. The Takemoto-Weerts family
      recently donated their mom&#146;s turtle collectibles after she
      died and we are very appreciative to them and also Glenda Jacobson
      for her generous donation of turtle items. They are greatly appreciated
      and help fund the club so we can keep the dues very low so everyone
      who wants to can become a member.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B><I>TURTLERAMA</I></B>
      was a huge success and thanks to all who made it great including,
      Suzanne, Hidde, Marion, Pam, John and Jerri, Sharon, Joy, Shirley,
      Julie, Lew, Ed Franke, the adorable Gable family, Craig, Kim,
      Chris and I&#146;m sure there are others &#150; if you&#146;ll
      let me know, I&#146;ll include your name in the next newsletter.
      The <B><I>Summer meeting</I></B> was held indoors much to the
      delight of our overheated club members. Thanks to those who attended
      on such a hot day expecting to be outdoors. You are a brave bunch!
      We were very lucky to be able to go indoors when the room suddenly
      became available.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We hear from our readers:
      </FONT></U></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Norm Wilson wrote
      (regarding tortoise egg laying) that it is common for a few eggs
      to become cracked either from hitting a small rock while being
      laid or hitting another egg as it falls into the nest. Sometimes
      eggs come out with a &#147;pressure fracture&#148;. These eggs
      would be quickly destroyed in the wild, but if you clean the
      egg up and apply a good coating of <B><U>GE SILICONE II</U></B><U>
      </U>Sealant over the fracture, the egg may be saved. On September
      12, Norm reported that two of the first eggs that hatched were
      the ones that had been cracked &#150; and decided it was time
      to tell all of us about his discovery. If you want to contact
      Norm for more information, please contact the club or visit his

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was another very strange summer,
      starting off with rather cold weather and finally settling into
      a comfortable warmth and the turtles and tortoises began acting
      normally after refusing to eat or even come out for the day when
      they thought winter had returned. I had a larger pond area built
      next to the Greenhouse and it is working out better than expected.
      <B><U>TRU GREEN LAND CARE 916-451-7566 </U></B>did the work for
      me in 104 degree temperatures and I was very pleased with the
      result. The turtles acclimated to their new pond immediately
      and appear to be &#145;playing&#146; as they climb out and jump
      back in, some leaping off of their bridge. I installed a canopy
      over the area for the work crew and since it looked very nice
      afterwards, I left it in place. Of course it will probably blow
      off during a winter storm so I have alerted hubby Bill to the
      fact that he will soon be building a wooden structure over the
      pond. To clean the pond I put a pump from Sears into it and within
      20 minutes the old water is out and the clean water is in.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Asian box turtles living
      at The Bunker have changed this year. They are beautiful turtles
      with sleek yellow heads, pink cheeks and mahogany colored shells.
      Normally they are shy but this year there has been a complete
      transformation and it happens each night as I give them a rain
      shower. First one will come out then another and another. I believe
      there are 6 males and two females. Pretty soon they are all out,
      wiggling themselves in the spray and drinking the water. The
      females are very casual, walking slowly about, not paying any
      attention to what is going on very close by. The males are like
      a marching band. They line up behind the females, slowly advancing
      in unison and then they do something very weird. They quickly
      scoot backwards! Two steps forward and three steps straight back
      like a choreographed dance line. Whatever they are doing, it
      is very amusing to watch and if guests come over, I turn on their
      shower so the show can begin! I&#146;ve had most of them for
      at least 15 years and have only hatched one baby, so I guess
      they are too busy dancing to do much else. They eat dog food,
      bananas, corn on the cob, worms, snails and even trout chow that
      bounces their way as I toss it in for the water turtles. They
      are very hardy and were the first ones to wake up soon after
      our hard freeze in 1990. If you ever have a chance to own one
      of these, go for it!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A tragedy was averted at The
      Bunker by an observant visitor who said, &#147;Is that turtle
      supposed to be in that bucket of water?&#148; I spun around.
      It was Cooper, the small Leopard tortoise (who was covered in
      poo last winter). He was one lucky guy. I had placed some grass
      clippings in the bucket the day before and I guess the rain filled
      up the bucket and he was sitting on top of the grass, wet, but
      not under the water. I took him out and dried him off, checked
      him over, he was ok, and he went on his way. But the question
      is: HOW DID HE GET INTO THE BUCKET?!! It&#146;s another Bunker
      mystery. If tortoises could talk, eh?</FONT></P>
