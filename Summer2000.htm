      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our next event is the TURTLERAMA
      on Saturday, July 22 from 11 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge Library
      located on the corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land Park
      Drive.  PLEASE let me know ASAP if you can exhibit, what you
      are going to exhibit, if you can help set up and help us clean
      up at the end,  answer questions, etc.  There seems to be less
      room each year so if you have a card table, bring it along in
      case you need it.  Dave said he would let us into the library
      room at 10 a.m. so please try to be there at that time so we
      can be reasonably ready for the public at 11.  THANKS TO ONE
      AND ALL AHEAD OF TIME.  There would not be any show without all
      of you participating.  It is greatly appreciated.<BR>
       <BR>
      Many thanks to Chad Inks who gave a very informative talk at
      our last meeting about map turtles.  He explained the different
      varieties, sub species, food and space requirements and the little
      turtles he had on display were very healthy and simply adorable
      with their bright round eyes looking around as they clung to
      their underwater logs.<BR>
       <BR>
      Sharon Chancellor will return as our guest speaker at the October
      21 meeting.  I don't know how Sharon can top her presentation
      at our Fall '99 meeting which included an array of edible plants
      for our tortoises; the explanation of the need for fecal exams
      for turtles and tortoises and showing us how to open a tortoise's
      mouth in order to pop in the medication.  <BR>
       <BR>
      For those who need to know how to open a tortoise's mouth:  Grasp
      the tortoise's head behind the jawline with your thumb and middle
      finger.  With your index (second) finger, push DOWN on the bottom
      jaw and simply pop in the medicine which you should have ready
      to go in your other hand.  After a little practice, it becomes
      simple.  The easiest tortoises to treat are desert tortoises
      and the most difficult are the Leopard tortoises who, when feel
      threatened, immediately pull their heads way inside and fold
      their arms tightly over their faces so you generally have only
      one chance at them.  <BR>
       <BR>
       SEE YOU AT THE TURTLERAMA!!</FONT></P>

      Avoid overheating.  Use a &quot;mister&quot; to add humidity
      to your box, water and tropical environments.  Asian box turtles
      &quot;come to life&quot; as soon as the misting begins.<BR>
       <BR>
      Make sure your fighters and biters are separated in your absence.
       You don't want to come home to find someone injured or upside
      down and dead.  <BR>
       <BR>
      Be careful mowing.  Walk the area ahead of time to be sure nobody
      is cuddling in the soft grass.  I mow just before dark when I
      know everyone is asleep and nobody sleeps in the middle of the
      lawn.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Provide shade for your egg layers.
       They could roast digging their nests in the midday sun. And
      place chairs around the lawn for quick shade if you don't have
      many trees.  <BR>
       <BR>
      Turtle not eating?  They sometimes &quot;estivate&quot; for a
      few weeks in the summertime, or females go off feed before egg
      laying.  Be ALERT!<BR>
       <BR>
      Before grinding down the overgrown beaks and nails, try feeding
      on a cement stepping stone and provide cement areas to walk on
      for a &quot;natural&quot; way of trimming as would happen in
      nature.    Let's hear your tips.<BR>

      FLAG DAY - JUNE 14th - I had promised to bring some turtles to
      a nearby assisted living facility.  The day started on a sour
      note.  I could not find my glasses.  The temperature was soaring
      above 109.  I chose 4 critters I could depend on to behave and
      not bite anyone.  These included a female Sulcata, around 5 pounds
      with a gentle personality, very timid;  a male Texas tortoise
      with similar traits; a very attractive male Eastern box turtle
      and a newborn slider to bring back memories of &quot;dime store
      turtles.&quot;   When I got to the facility, there were about
      50 residents in the room anxious to hear about turtles and tortoises.<BR>
       <BR>
      I did my presentation during what was also the residents monthly
      birthday party.   Everyone was served cake, ice-cream and soft
      drinks.  I decided to carry each critter around the room so everyone
      could have a close-up view.  Some folks were afraid but others
      reached out to touch their shells.   The Sulcata was a big hit
      because her shell was so pretty, therefore, she was carried around
      more than the others.   My fingers were crossed, but my luck
      finally ran out.<BR>
       <BR>
      I had my left hand under the front of her plastron and my right
      hand under her rear end with a paper towel in between.  I suddenly
      felt her legs jump, her head went in and my right hand began
      filling with something hot and wet.  I instinctively tilted her
      up and took my hand away and all of the people began screaming
      as the PROJECTILE POO flew across the room, dousing the coffee
      table, carpeting and several wheelchairs, the residents feet,
      just missing the big-screen TV.  It looked like a fire hose but
      that was not water shooting out.  This ended Turtle Day at Grand
      Court and the June Y2K birthday bash.  And I don't suppose I
      will ever be invited for a return visit......<BR>
       <BR>
      There is a tiny bit more to this story.  It is in regards to
      a forgotten 15 pound round watermelon I had purchased the day
      before and covered with a blanket to keep it out of the sun.
       As I was driving home with the tortoises in their boxes in the
      back of the station wagon including the baby turtle in a plastic
      shoe box, someone cut in front of me causing me to stop short
      and as I glanced into my rear-view mirror all I could see was
      the big watermelon rolling out from under the blanket heading
      directly towards the turtles. </FONT></P>

      It is summertime at The Bunker with many turtles spending time
      at &quot;summer camp&quot; creating much more work for me, of
      course.   But it is fun watching them interact and making sure
      everyone is behaving and getting enough to eat and drink.   The
      regular exotic residents are happy to be out of the Greenhouse
      and are making the most of the warm sunny days, grazing on the
      lawn and resting under the bushes.   The bad boy Greeks are safely
      in their own areas.  The Hermann's tortoises can always be counted
      on to provide endless activity and amusement.  The males never
      tire of chasing the females and the females never tire of running
      away.   This goes on nine months out of the  year.  The females
      seem to enjoy being chased because they will pause, look behind
      them to make sure the male is nearby, and then continue on. 
       As a rule, more than one male is chasing the female and they
      never sit still for mating purposes.  They need to become &quot;trapped&quot;
      in order to breed and the only way it ever happens in my yard
      is when they get stuck in the doorway of their doghouse.   I
      may have defeated my own breeding project by buying a few new
      dog houses with wider doorways!  <BR>
       <BR>
      In a recent Turtle Tales newsletter from the Turtle and Tortoise
      Club of Florida, they mentioned my first video and questioned
      the water turtles in the wading pools and how &quot;sanitary&quot;
      the water was and how much work I was creating for myself.  
      I found this to be very interesting and have written to ask them
      how to keep turtles in a more natural setting without the water
      getting smelly.    I'll let you know what they say.    Meanwhile,
      I don't use the wading pools any longer, except to house the
      overflow sliders coming in until they go to their new homes........I
      have a small pool sunk in the gound which is 8 inches deep by
      about four feet long by three feet wide.   I &quot;clean&quot;
      it by allowing the hose to slowly run in and overflow every other
      day.   The turtles drag in dirt as they go in and out and in
      the winter I don't clean it at all but leave it muddy.   Please
      share your ideas too.<BR>
       <BR>
      OK, who left that jar of rotted, maggot infested snails on my
      doorstep?  UGH!</FONT></P>

      Please make provisions for your creatures just in case.  And
      don't will them to me!!  We recently lost Cindy Tufts and her
      family was forced to deal with her untimely death and the painful
      task of finding good homes for the large tortoises.  Most spouses
      and children do not share the same enthusiasm towards reptiles
      as you do.  Put your wishes on a piece of paper or let me know
      and I'll keep it on file here and help all I can.    Our deepest
      sympathy goes out to Cindy's family and also the family of Clyde
      O. Brown, long time member.   </FONT>
