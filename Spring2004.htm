       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> </FONT></U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Our
      Spring meeting will be held on <B>Saturday, April 17th</B> from
      1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge Library located on the corner
      of Fruitridge Road and South Land Park Drive close to I-5. <B>Darlene
      Pond and Cheryl Darnell</B>, who co-chair the Reno TurToise Club,
      will be coming to the meeting (weather permitting) to talk about
      the Desert Tortoise Symposium they recently attended in Las Vegas
      and will answer questions you have about the care and feeding
      of desert tortoises. Cheryl would also like to share an exhibit
      with you regarding a box turtle that had been run over and half
      of its shell was destroyed. She brought it back to health and
      will tell you how she did it. Cheryl does wonders with sick and
      injured turtles and tortoises.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Darlene told me of a demonstration
      of tortoise-finding dogs at the symposium. They have been trained
      to sniff out tortoises in the desert. While wildlife biologists
      can find 45 to 55%, the dogs find 98% of them! Isn&#146;t that
      amazing? They are trained the same way people train dogs to find
      drugs. At the symposium, they had six cardboard boxes spread
      all over the room with juvenile desert tortoises in two of them.
      The dog went to the right ones immediately. Everyone was impressed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We&#146;ll also be discussing
      post-hibernation problems at the meeting and show impromptu incubators
      for those surprised by eggs before you had a regular incubator
      ready. Last year some tortoises were laying eggs in February.
      I have not had any reports of that happening this year, however,
      it&#146;s very important to be ready for eggs at all times.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Does anyone remember March
      7? It was the first warm day we had since last October. I was
      happy to see 99% of the hibernating turtles suddenly basking
      with only one casualty floating in the pond. After the long,
      cold, wet, foggy, dreary winter, it was wonderful to see my old
      friends again. I&#146;m sure you all felt the same way. I had
      a lot of reports of box turtles developing swollen eyes after
      they emerged. My advice was to soak them often in warm water
      up to their nostrils and I don&#146;t mean for 5 minutes. Start
      by keeping them in water for about 24 hours. Most of them are
      dehydrated and this helps. After that, an hour a day should be
      sufficient. Meanwhile, treat the eyes with Terramycin Ophthalmic
      Ointment twice a day in each eye; or any other ophthalmic ointment
      you may have in your medicine cabinet for animals or people.
      I order the ointment from The Bean Farm at <A HREF="http://www.beanfarm.com/">www.beanfarm.com</A>
      or call them at 1-425-861-7964. It&#146;s important to have some
      on hand at all times. Don&#146;t wait until tomorrow or next
      week. Treat the eyes immediately. A turtle or tortoise that cannot
      see will not eat.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I would like to remind you
      that it is OK to leave your &#147;indoor&#148; turtles and tortoises
      outdoors overnight (under shelter, of course) when the nighttime
      temperatures are 50 degrees or more. It&#146;s not how cold it
      is but how long it is cold.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">SPRING HINTS:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> It&#146;s that time again &#150; time
      to inspect the yard for little white rocks the tortoises love
      to eat. Try to get rid of as many as you can. The soil turns
      over every year revealing new ones. It&#146;s a never-ending
      problem. Look for hair, fur, pins, rubberbands, baggie ties,
      string, small pits and other harmful debris. Be Alert! Dangers
      are everywhere. Ravens can pick up hatchlings and other turtles
      as large as Russian tortoises, so try to protect your smaller
      chelonians. Never leave your dog alone with your turtles.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Club member, Mary Halbrook,
      told me about a product called the <B>&#147;Driveway Patrol&#148;
      </B>she had bought at Fry&#146;s Electronics store. Of course
      it is a product to be set up in your driveway to let you know
      if someone is approaching, but we know it has an even better
      purpose. It&#146;s a great predator alert! Being too lazy to
      go to Fry&#146;s, I bought my unit from someone on eBay and set
      it up in the back yard. I attached the transmitter to my back
      porch facing the tortoise pens and ponds and set the alarm unit
      on the kitchen counter. A few nights later, I almost fell out
      of my chair when the alarm went off and when I dashed to the
      door, I saw a huge possum running through the yard. Luckily,
      it kept on going, but I set up the Havahart trap anyway. The
      alarm unit can be left outside to scare off the predator, but
      I&#146;m not sure your neighbors would appreciate this loud noise
      at 3 in the morning. Driveway Patrol costs about $20 and is well
      worth it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It seemed as if winter would
      never end. Did it seem that way to any of you? I miss the box
      turtles as the cold months drag on. I miss seeing the tortoises
      going about their daily routine of basking, eating, napping,
      basking, eating and napping. Finally it is April and our pets
      are coming back to life (although it started in March this year).
      Unfortunately, there are bound to be casualties now and then.
      It is usually Mother Nature at work so don&#146;t blame yourself
      if there is a death. Most of the time, illnesses are well hidden
      until the inevitable happens.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A few weeks ago, a surprise
      arrived At The Bunker. Her name is Luna. The surprise turned
      out to be on me. She came in disguised as a Greek female tortoise.
      I was very pleased to accept her because there are several lonely
      males living here all going by the name of Just Jim. She was
      delivered at night so I didn&#146;t get a very good look at her,
      but at first glance, she was a healthy female. She was obviously
      not pleased and left her huge droppings on my front porch as
      the transfer was made. I smiled and took her inside and gently
      placed her into a clean box for the night. In the morning, after
      I finished my cup of tea, I picked her up to say hello and I
      thought that she just didn&#146;t look right. She kind of looked
      like a Greek, but something was wrong. What the heck was that
      hinge on her shell? Greeks don&#146;t have hinges. Darn! She&#146;s
      a Bell&#146;s Hingeback tortoise! Oh well. The boys will have
      to wait awhile longer for their dream to come true.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A clutch of leopard tortoise
      eggs hatched at the beginning of February. These eggs were laid
      in the greenhouse last September. I left them alone until the
      time came to put the large tortoises back into the greenhouse
      at the end of October. I tried to protect the nest but it was
      impossible. The leopards were determined to move the bricks and
      wire and defecate and urinate on that spot.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I had to risk digging up the
      eggs because if I didn&#146;t, none would have hatched, yet I
      really didn&#146;t know if I was going to kill them by digging
      them up halfway through their incubation. I needed to give them
      a chance at life. I moved them to my indoor incubator. There
      were 9 eggs in that clutch. 8 hatched and they are so beautiful,
      light in color, like their mother, Blondie. The 9th egg, which
      did not hatch with the others, seemed heavy and I became concerned
      when, after two weeks, it still had not hatched. I did not want
      to break it open because this is never a good idea. I went to
      Plan B. Music! My keyboard and speakers share the room with the
      incubator and I decided to play some upbeat songs one night including
      &#147;I Will Survive&#148; and lo and behold, when I looked into
      the incubator the next morning, I could see tiny cracks in the
      egg. I was cautiously optimistic because there was a chance it
      was getting ready to explode. After dinner, I peeked in again
      and was so happy to see a perfectly formed leopard hatchling
      sitting there, completely out of its egg.</FONT></P>
