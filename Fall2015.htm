      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our FALL meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, October 17th,</B><BR>
       at the <B>Robbie Waters Library, 7335 Gloria Drive, 95831 </B>(it's
      also on Havenside),  and we have the room from 4 pm until whenever
      we are finished.  Father Dimitri has kindly accepted my invitation
      to do the pre-hibernation checkups once again so feel free to
      bring your turtle or tortoise for him to look at and tell you
      &quot;yes&quot;,  &quot;no&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;???  Please
      keep your pet in a box and off of the floor for sanitary reasons
      and please do not carry it around the room because accidents
      DO happen!!         It is also our POT-LUCK meeting so feel free
      to bring lots of food to share.  If I remember correctly, there
      was quite a delicious array of food brought in last Fall.  Sharon,
      your meatballs were spectacular!!!  There will be lots of plants
      out front, many of which were leftover from the TURTLERAMA. 
      I've babied them along since then and hope they all find new
      homes and yards to thrive in.  Thanks for all of your plant donations!
       Hoping you can also bring some treasures for the raffle!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The TURTLERAMA was such a huge
      success and we have been invited to have it in front of INCREDIBLE
      PETS again next year!!   I've picked AUGUST 13thas the day. 
      I believe it is the weekend before school starts so there should
      not be any problems with other activities that day.  Thank you
      all for your participation this year.  I was very surprised to
      see so many of you there displaying your pets!!  The summer meeting
      was not too crowded and nobody seemed to want to pay any attention
      to what I had to say and I figured the Turtlerama would not be
      as good as in past years but you all came through and were there
      to show off your pets, and even sell a few but mostly give out
      good information to the public who are at the mercy of the Internet's
        very     misleading  information about caring for turtles and
      tortoises.   It was such a wonderful day, not too hot, the shade
      was just right and the crowd was overwhelming!!  Thanks to the
      employees of Incredible Pets for allowing us to use their sidewalk;
      a few parking spots; and their bathroom and get water for our
      pools and plants, etc.  from their pet bathing area inside of
      the store.  IT WAS APPRECIATED.  I'll give a full list of our
      members who were there, exhibiting and helping, on the copy of
      this newsletter that will be on our website in a few days. But
      I will say a big THANK YOU TO ONE AND ALL.  THAT WAS SOME TURNOUT!!

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, a lot of you are wishing
      we could go back to having Saturday afternoon meetings.  I hear
      you and went to the Parkside Church (which is close to Belle
      Cooledge) and asked about using their lovely meeting room (with
      a small stage!!) for our meetings and they seemed to be leaning
      towards saying yes to our seasonal meetings next year, so sit
      tight and I will let you know ASAP how that works out.  Of course
      if you'd rather stay where we are, that is ok too. Just let me
      know - we can discuss this at the meeting which leads me to say:</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">FALL HINTS:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Look for baby box turtles and even
      tortoises in the yard, especially after a gentle rain.  Jim Corbett
      and I were sitting in my yard recently discussing our favorite
      topic when a baby box turtle strolled out in front of us.  We
      jumped up and began looking for more!!  And we did find a total
      of 5.  Jim found a nest with emerging hatchlings in the middle
      of the lawn!!!  I know there are more out there ready to come
      up..  And if a person does not find the baby, a bird will, so
      - BE ALERT!!!  Check the tortoise burrows if you have any to
      make sure they are secure and won't flood or collapse.  We have
      been spoiled by very little rain the last few years and that
      could change so try to do what you can to prevent a disaster.
        Is anyone showing signs of illness?  Is the tortoise or turtle
      light weight?  Sluggish is normal at this time of the year but
      swollen eyelids are not normal.  Or any body swelling.  I know
      you all can't come to the meetings so try to do exams yourself
      and let us know if you see anything suspicious.  If you are new
      to the club, make sure your turtle or tortoise is a species that
      is supposed to hibernate.  Our Facebook page is full of knowledgeable
      people so don't hesitate to ask.  And remember that you don't
      HAVE to let your pet hibernate.  If you are really nervous about
      it, we'll help you figure out away to keep it awake and healthy
      all winter with minimum stress. Don't let your guard down regarding
      raccoons, possums and rats.  They are always near......yes, scary......</FONT></P>

      A few weeks ago, I received an email regarding a California Desert
      Tortoise which was found near the Bay Area and F&amp;W were being
      notified about it since the people who found the tortoise believed
      it to be a CDT.  So I asked for a photo since I rarely if ever
      hear of any desert tortoises being found loose in that area.
      The photo arrived.  Sure enough, it was a fully grown - GREEK
      - male tortoise.  It was decided that the tortoise should live
      here happily with others just like him.  And so, he was delivered
      by a very very nice lady who loved seeing the other tortoises.
       The couple named the tortoise Merlin 2 and he was a perfect
      gentleman in the yard, walking around, sniffing everything and
      seemed to be quite content in his new surroundings.  He found
      a cozy doghouse to sleep in.   The next day, around noon, a lovely
      young lady arrived to pick up a few box turtles and I thought
      I would show her the yard and the turtles and tortoises who live
      here.  We rounded the corner to the side yard where the larger
      tortoises, Blondie and Tarzan, hang out and suddenly we were
      both staring at this tortoise running towards us, full speed
      ahead.  I thought it was Zappo the Wacko. but it wasn't.  He
      was MUCH FASTER,  head held HIGH and he caused us to run as fast
      as we could to the back porch and up onto the steps in order
      to get away from Merlin!!!!  I had my sneakers on and the other
      gal was wearing white flip flops but managed to run for her life
      in them.  He definitely was after her feet and not mine.  We
      did not go back outside!!  I was very concerned because Merlin
      was running much faster than Zappo ever did but we did not stop
      to find out what he would do if he caught up to us.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What causes this abnormal behavior
      in my yard?  I don't hear anyone else complaining about tortoises
      attacking their feet!  Yes, sometimes a tortoise will gently
      nip at painted toenails thinking they are food, but nothing like
      this aggressive behavior.  Zappo will chase anyone and try to
      bite and then furously mate with their feet.  I'm not sure what
      Merlin 2 would have done but I did buy myself a pair of sturdy
      ankle boots at Big 5 yesterday and will NEVER go out into my
      back yard without wearing them because these sneak attacks are
      causing awful things to happen - TO ME!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But out of this chaos, something
      long forgotten became clear to me regarding Merlin 2.  He has
      never been with a female tortoise or if he was, he has no memory
      which is probably why he is chasing them all around the yard
      which I am happy to see.  You've all heard me complaining about
      my males not interested at all and the girls laying lots of empty
      eggs.......ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER!!!  That must
      be what is going on here.  The males are so used to being around
      the females that they do not see them as partners so next spring
      I'll begin experimenting.  I will attempt to separate some of
      the males for a week or two and then put them back into the pen
      and see if that sparks any interest in the females.  I highly
      encourage any of you who have this problem to try it as well.
