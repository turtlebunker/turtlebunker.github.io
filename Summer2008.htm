      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Summer meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, July 19th</B> from 1:30 until 4 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library located on the corner of South Land Park
      Drive and Fruitridge Road.  The<B> TURTLERAMA </B>will be held
      4 weeks after the meeting <B>(Aug 16) </B>so I will be asking
      you for your help once again to make it a success.  As you know,
      it's a very popular event and last year, if anybody remembers,
      it was listed right next to the State Fair as a place to go!!
       It doesn't get any better than that!!!  Please let me know ASAP
      either at the meeting or via email or snail mail if you can exhibit
      your pets and/or set up an educational display.  We also need
      lots of helpers who can assist the exhibitors set up and break
      down their displays.   There is usually food in the library kitchen
      for exhibitors only and since it's hard to break away from the
      crowd, we need helpers to bring refreshments to the exhibitors
      as well.  Help cleaning up at the end is always appreciated.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Please try to bring a turtle
      or a tortoise to the July meeting for Show and Tell.  Let us
      know its name and how it got that name and how it lives in your
      yard.  Let us know what it eats and if there is anything unique
      about its behavior.  They all have their little quirks, don't
      they?  We can always use turtle items for the raffle, so please
      look through your stash and see if there is anything you can
      part with, even if your mother in law gave it to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting was heavily
      attended and very interesting.  Michael Rajkumar gave a slide
      presentation of a tortoise having bladder surgery to remove a
      stone.  Thanks, Michael, it was quite informative.  Father Dimitri
      had very complimentary words about our club, explaining that
      it is not a 'society' with board meetings, etc. but simply a
      friendly club for those interested in turtles and tortoises to
      enjoy  our hobby and gather together several times a year for
      turtle talk and sharing information and ideas.  We don't plan
      on changing anything because everything seems to work so well,
      however, sometimes, things go terribly wrong.  Read On.....</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">THE CAKE!!</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">   The Spring meeting commemorated our
      <B>27th Anniversary</B>.  I had bought a beautiful sheet cake
      for the event.  I placed the cake, which was sealed in its container,
      on the table in the back of the room.  In my tote bag were a
      #2 and a #7 candle and matches to light them with and a pretty
      cake knife.  It was my intention to light the candles, say a
      few words about the status of the club and personally cut the
      cake and give you each a piece and thank you sincerely for your
      support.  -  After Michael's slide show, I made my way to the
      back of the room with the candles, matches and knife in my hand.
       Imagine my complete disappointment to see &frac34; of the cake
      hacked up and gone! I hope none of you heard my unkind words
      as I stuck the two candles in the few remaining pieces of cake
      and lit them and sadly returned to the front of the room.  I
      don't know who decided to open the container and cut the cake.
       I do not know where the knife came from but I hope it was clean.
       My only wish is that the person who did it is never invited
      to a wedding!!  As my husband said, &#147;This Takes The Cake!!&#148;</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Watch out for predators.  Rats seem
      to be doing more damage lately and attack during the day.  One
      member keeps 3 box turtles in a greenhouse and left the door
      ajar and went to work.  She came home to find two brutally murdered.
       Only a rat could have done that during the day.  Please  be
      alert.   In addition, if we get hot weather, please keep your
      box turtles on the moist side and provide plenty of fresh water
      for all of your creatures.  Provide shade for those turtles in
      child's wading pools.  Fake trees you no longer need give good
      shade.  Don't forget to sit back and enjoy your pets as often
      as possible.  Turtle watching is fun and I know we don't do it
      often enough in our busy lives.  Watch for egg laying when the
      moon is full.  Put a rock over the nest so the next turtle doesn't
      come along and dig in the same hole.  If you don't dig up the
      eggs, mark the rock so you don't forget what is under it!!  Have
      a great summer.  I hope everyone stays healthy!  </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT THE BUNKER<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      A life saved!!  About 6 weeks ago, I was cleaning out the pond
      as I try to do once a week.  I put the Sears utility pump in
      and started it up.  There are about 13 turtles in the pond, all
      hanging out at the bottom, seemingly enjoying the cleaning activity.
       As the water was nearly out, I reached down to clear the debris
      from the pump and noticed a lifeless pond turtle. I picked her
      up, feeling bad &#150; I hadn't noticed anyone sick &#150; and
      put her on the edge of the pond.  As I was filling the pond,
      I sat down and put her on my lap and I have no idea why I decided
      to try to resuscitate her.  I had tried this before on drowning
      victims and it never worked.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I held her in my left hand, face
      down, and with my right hand, pumped her back legs alternately
      into her tummy cavity and supported her lifeless head, which
      was bobbing about like a wet noodle, with my index finger.  For
      no reason at all except for a vague feeling, I continued only
      stopping once to turn off the hose.  After about 20 minutes,
      I thought I detected a slight movement of an eye.  Then I held
      my breath as her head began to come up on its own.  I kept at
      it until I got tired and it seemed she was coming back to life.
       It was quite a good feeling.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I eventually placed her in a
      plastic shoebox tilted downward so fluid could drain from her
      lungs.  Late that night, I reluctantly went to sleep.  Whatever
      I did must have worked because the next morning, she seemed as
      good as new.  I placed her in a shallow pond to keep an eye on
      her and so far, she shows no sign of illness and is eating and
      swimming very well.   I have no idea what could have happened
      to cause her near-death experience.  The pond water is not clear
      when I lower the pump in and I always lower it in slowly so the
      turtles can get out of the way.  And I can feel if it is on a
      solid bottom or rocking on a turtle's back!  If turtles could
      talk, eh?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, all of the male Greek
      tortoises are now living with the box turtles whom they do not
      molest.  They came out of hibernation and as soon as I put the
      Leopard tortoises (who are much bigger than they are) out onto
      the lawn for the summer, the three of them (all named Just Jim)
      proceeded to relentlessly hunt them down, ram and mount them,
      including a small male Sulcata who is now ready for therapy.
       So, into seclusion they went.  It's better for everyone.  And
      peace has returned (almost) to The Bunker.  The only remaining
      problem is Chester, the ancient Elongata.  He follows Tarzan
      Jr. around the yard and altho he's not very good at ramming,
      he kind of rocks back and forth and then falls forward, failing
      to hit his target!  Tarzan usually sits there, ignoring the clumsy
      tortoise behind him.  I do not like when Chester appears at midnight
      on the back porch waiting for a banana to appear.  Yes, I always
      throw one out to him. I am well trained.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As you all know, I get a lot
      of sliders in for adoption and I put them into a child's wading
      pool to make sure they are healthy before being adopted to loving
      homes.   I can always tell which turtles have been kept in aquariums
      due to the amount of pebbles and colored gravel that appears
      in the water after they've been here for a few days.  This is
      proof that they actually eat this stuff and I imagine they can
      become impacted if they eat enough of it, so don't use it no
      matter how 'good' it looks!  And remember our motto: <B> &#147;Aquariums
      Are For Fish!&#148;</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the Fall meeting, Bobbi Bartley
      handed me 5 tiny sliders someone had given to her.  Since I have
      never learned to say 'no', I took them and had no idea of how
      to care for them throughout the winter.  I decided to put them
      into a big bucket in the greenhouse.   I had a bucket of clean
      water next to them so when the water got dirty, I could just
      transfer them over.  They somehow all survived and are growing
      quite nicely.  Thanks Bobbi.  This made up for the ones in the
      plastic bowl with a palm tree that were flushed when I was a
      little girl in The Bronx.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There is a small Sulcata here
      who eats seeds out of a bird feeder alongside the birds.  What's
      up with that?  Maybe he was raised with birds before ending up
      with me?   And yesterday morning at 6, I was jarred awake by
      the sound of metal being dragged across concrete.  I thought
      it was the men who noisily pick up the yard clippings every Friday,
      but this was Thursday.  I got out of bed and looked out of the
      window and saw Tarzan Jr. walking along the side yard with an
      old rusty metal stepping stool stuck on his back.  Instead of
      walking around it, he kept going straight, as tortoises do, dragging
      it  along with him until it toppled over with a huge clang! 
      At least I could go back to sleep at that point.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Soon after Blondie's last batch
      of eggs hatched in February, I noticed a solitary egg sitting
      on the heat mat in the greenhouse.  I picked it up and figured
      it was infertile but decided to incubate it anyway.  I always
      tell all of you to treat every egg as if it is fertile, so I
      followed my own advice.  As I go to press at this time on June
      20th, I can see a little tortoise face peeking out of the egg.
        WOW!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker needs a little sprucing
      up.  Any volunteers out there?  NO CHILDREN PLEASE and you must
      have a sense of humor.   The Bermuda grass has overtaken an area
      of the yard where it does not belong.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Enjoy the summer and even tho
      you don't like the hot weather, it is wonderful for our pets.
       Thanks again for your continued support.</FONT></P>
