      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Spring meeting will
      be held on Saturday <B>April 18th</B> at the Belle Cooledge Library
      (5600 South Land Park Drive  95822) from 1:30 until 4.  <B>&quot;Coming
      Out Of Hibernation&quot; </B>will be our main topic.  There is
      always plenty to talk about regarding feeding, soaking, illnesses,
      lethargy, swellings, etc. etc.  I do hope most of your turtles
      hibernated successfully and woke up alert and hungry.  Some of
      our pets will continue sleeping for another month!!  Some of
      the females of all species may begin laying eggs as early as
      April so be prepared.  I'll have a few examples of inexpensive
      incubators at the meeting.  If you choose to leave the eggs in
      the ground, then cover the spot so another turtle doesn't come
      along and lay eggs in the same nest or perhaps the same mother
      will return to lay her second clutch in the same spot.  Trust
      those who have gone before you.  It happens!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This meeting will also mark our
      club's <B>28th anniversary</B>.  I will bring a cake, however,
      it will be on the table behind me this time so nobody will be
      able to cut it up and give it out before we are ready for it
      as they did last year.  Come to think of it, let's just have
      the cake first!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Your turtles are always welcome
      for Show and Tell, so please consider giving a short presentation.
       We definitely need to share information whether it be good or
      bad.  If you are too shy to speak in front of a room full of
      people, write it down and hand it to me.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our January Slumberama was anything
      but!!  It was a beautiful day, as always, on that third Saturday
      in January.  There was a good crowd, lots of good food and a
      good raffle and lots of good turtle talk!  Thank you all for
      your continued support, great attendance and raffle and sale
      table and pot-luck and $$$ donations.  YOU ARE ALL TERRIFIC!!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">TURTLE SLANGUAGE </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">-  Ever since I wrote &quot;Don't Call
      Us Boxies&quot; in one of my newsletters, people have been asking
      me what it means.  It all began when I heard someone refer to
      a box turtle as a 'boxie'.  I thought they were talking about
      men's underwear or a popular breed of dog.  It did not dawn on
      me that they were talking about box turtles.  The word 'boxie'
      was repeated and in no time at all, other people were saying
      it and I was terribly disheartened to see the word 'boxie' appearing
      in various turtle and tortoise club newsletters.  What is going
      on?  What is happening?  Could it be a case of TURTLE SLANGUAGE??</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here are other examples of what
      people are calling their pets:  Chinese Boxies, Juvvies, Margies,
      Fecal People, Hermies, Hingies, Leps, Trops, Bellies, Panqueques,
      Flat Packs, Chummy Stackers, Soft Rockers, Gulfies, Woodies,
      Horsies, Turds, Rushies, Sulkies, The POOPS, Torties.  And last
      but not least, when a turtle or tortoise is ill, it becomes a
      SICKIE!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Keeping turtles and tortoises
      has a certain stigma attached to it.  We keepers are likely to
      be thought of as weird by those who have no use for shelled creatures.
       Therefore, we must pursue our hobby with a great deal of dignity
      and respect.  Although we love our pets, we must be careful not
      to appear silly since most people don't see turtles and tortoises
      as being 'cuddly' creatures to be cooed to and hugged.  If you
      want to call them 'boxies' in private, that's fine, but please
      don't put it into print for all the world to see and possibly
      giggle at.  If one subscribes to magazines such as Dog Fancy
      or Horse Fancy or Cat Fancy, you never see anyone referring to
      their animals as doggies, horsies, froggies or puddy-wuddy's.
      CASE CLOSED!!   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sliders Sliders Everywhere!!
       I can't help myself.  I cannot say NO to anyone who wants to
      give their turtles away - however - this winter I begged people
      to wait until the weather got a little warmer since I have no
      indoor facilities for water turtles.  I did adopt 9 out to a
      gentleman with a 9000 gallon pond a few days ago.  Please get
      on the adoption list if you have a pond in need of more turtles.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There were several casualties
      over the winter in the main pond.  I'm a little nervous, hoping
      there is no disease going through my colony.  I try to keep the
      new turtles separated from the long term pets but sometimes enthusiastic
      people will drop their turtles into my pond without first asking
      me if it is ok.  I would have necropsies done on the deceased
      but a vet told me that one would cost more than $600 and to save
      my money because the results are never conclusive.  Has anyone
      ever learned the true cause of death besides an obvious bladder
      stone or impacted or broken egg?  Almost all deaths are blamed
      on 'liver problems'</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Winter was a bit harsh here in
      Sacramento with icy nights and cold days.  On February 20th,
      however, I noticed some turtles basking and a few tortoises,
      mainly Russians and Greeks, sitting out in the afternoon sun.
        Fat Betty emerged on February 27th ready for another season
      of weather forecasting.  She feels it will be a cool summer in
      spite of the global warming predictions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim Junior appeared in mid-February
      with no indication as to where he had been hibernating.  He looked
      good tho, dry and healthy.   I notice that the tortoises who
      are allowed to roam the yard and then hibernate wherever they
      see fit, do a lot better than the ones I try to put into hibernation
      elsewhere.  They seem restless and keep coming out to bask even
      in the pouring rain.  It's as if they have a death wish.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, indoors, about 18
      leopard tortoises hatched but most won't be up for sale until
      they are eating and thriving.  They joined the 4 baby box turtles
      lost and found by the cat a few months ago and a box turtle given
      to me by a gentleman from Lake Tahoe.  The turtle sits patiently
      awaiting his daily mealworms and nightcrawlers after a very shy
      beginning.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Greenhouse residents had
      a very quiet winter.  Nobody got sick!  Doug, the deformed leopard
      who had been kept in an aquarium, refused to eat for awhile,
      but after a long soak one day, he began to eat and hasn't slowed
      down yet!  His girlfriend, Darwin,who has the same abnormalities,
      has continued to eat well but these two are so deformed that
      it is a worry.  I do hope that once outdoors, they will be able
      to grow out of these 'lumps' somewhat and be able to walk like
      normal tortoises.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There is a small Sulcata here
      who had a prolapse and I didn't want to adopt him out in that
      condition and I didn't want to take him to a vet either because
      he didn't seem uncomfortable and could resolve the problem whenever
      he felt like it.  The problem seems much better now.  But another
      problem has come to light.  I really like this feisty little
      guy!!  And he likes me!  He is very personable and quite the
      handsome one.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'll be glad to say goodbye to
      this winter.  We never know what is going to happen during hibernation
      and it is so good to see our little friends again at this time.
       I know we all do our very best to keep them alive. Please consider
      buying a DRIVEWAY PATROL to protect your pets from raccoons.
       Check the website.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Spring Reminders:  </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">CLEAN UP THE YARD!!  You don't want any
      little white rocks around because most tortoises love to eat
      them.  Human and pet hair can be a problem on the ground as are
      baggie ties, string, nails and screws and even basins full of
      water.  Tortoises seem drawn to where they shouldn't be.  I may
      be doing a bad thing by feeding the birds because the seeds are
      on the lawn below the feeder and some tortoises are eating it.
       I've since put a large bucket beneath the feeder to catch the
      seed.  DUH!! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I believe there will be many
      box turtles and some tortoises for sale at the Spring meeting
      and I have gotten a lot of nice donations for our sale table
      and raffle.  See you there!!</FONT></P>
