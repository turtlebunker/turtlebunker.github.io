      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I write this newsletter at
      the end of December, the daytime temperatures are near 70 degrees.
      While most of the box turtles are hibernating, there are a handful
      of them acting as if it were July. They are eating and going
      into the ponds for a daily swim. The male Hermann's tortoises
      are out and about every day and eating. If I don't feed them,
      they simply eat the grass. I know they are supposed to go into
      hibernation with an empty stomach, but they don't know that.
      I advise you to keep an eye on your box and water turtles that
      are still awake outside. While they may slow down on foggy and
      rainy days, they might not hibernate at all. Don't rush anyone
      into the house tho. Just observe, and if you see anyone sitting
      out all night, then you might want to consider bringing that
      one indoors. Above all, let them be turtles!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">About two weeks after the October
      meeting, I was expecting my sister and brother-in-law to visit
      for a week. I decided it was time to clean up the kitchen and
      put things away in order to make<BR>
      the area look as tidy as possible. There were still two trays
      of box turtle eggs sitting on the counter. They were starting
      to smell. I placed them downstairs on top of my dryer where they
      quickly became buried under an assortment of newspapers, old
      mail, catalogs and laundry. About three weeks went by. Company
      came and went. I finally got a chance to go through the pile
      of stuff on the dryer. I was quietly scanning the newspapers
      and discarding them when I suddenly came upon the eggs which
      I obviously had completely forgotten about. Nice going! I was
      afraid to look. I peeked in. Three tiny faces were looking up
      at me. At least they were alive. No thanks to me. From now on,
      no matter who is coming to visit, the eggs stay in full view!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And then it was the day before
      Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring,
      not even a turtle.....and then the telephone rang. My husband
      answered it and quickly handed it to me. A desperate voice asked,
      &quot;Do you have any dead turtles I could have?&quot; My dreamy
      mood was<BR>
      broken. I asked this person what her plans were because we would
      not want the departed to become a practical joke. I was assured
      they would be put to good use and, therefore, I did fulfill her
      Christmas wish. I don't know about you, but my Christmas wish
      does not include a gift wrapped turtle carcass under the tree.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Since The Bunker is quiet for
      the winter months, I can focus my attention on the people I am
      in contact with every day and this activity constantly reminds
      me of why we exist as a club. Imagine finding a turtle and bringing
      it into a pet shop for identification and having the manager
      say, &quot;It's a<BR>
      yellow turtle. Feed it lettuce.&quot; Or the guy who emailed
      me asking why his two baby African Sulcatas wouldn't hibernate;
      someone wanted a turtle for her three year old to play with and
      a few others wanted turtles for their classrooms.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Greenhouse is providing a
      cozy winter home for the exotic tortoises, although it is not
      easy keeping it clean. One tortoise is able to create quite a
      mess, imagine a dozen! With a smile on my face and a scraper
      and a plastic bag in my hand (and a clothespin on my nose) I
      enter The Greenhouse to do my daily chore. Oh, it smells so bad.
      HURRY SPRING!!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EARS</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tortoises have only rudimentary
      ears and consequently their hearing is not good. The ears can
      be seen, especially on the lighter colored specimen; if you look
      carefully at the side of their head, you will notice a blackish
      marked scale. Occasionally tortoises do get ear infections, usually
      visible<BR>
      as a small round bulge. Do not delay a visit to the vet as this
      will need treatment. Some antibiotics might be prescribed, possibly
      an antibiotic ear lotion. Keep the patient warm and in hygienic
      conditions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is difficult to judge how
      bad a tortoise's hearing is, some of the younger ones definitely
      seem to react to a dog's bark, the closing of a door or even
      footsteps. I once dropped a metal tray quite close to a tortoise.
      The animal was turned away from me so could not have seen the
      tray being<BR>
      dropped, yet, to my surprise immediately withdrew with the characteristic
      hissing noise into its shell.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The noise of the food tray being
      put down usually brings some reaction. As tortoises' sense of
      smell is very well developed, it might be the smell of the fresh
      greens and fruits that provoke the reaction, but even when the
      tray is put down empty, some of the tortoises will look up and
      come forward. It has been suggested that hearing deteriorates
      with age, an observation I feel could be correct as the older
      females especially do not seem to react to noise very strongly.</FONT></P>
