      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will be held
      on <U>Saturday, April 22nd </U>at the Belle Cooledge Library
      from 1:30 until 4. The library is located on the corner of South
      Land Park Drive and Fruitridge Road. We will be celebrating the
      <B><I>25th anniversary </I></B>of the club so there will be some
      reminiscing, talking about what we have accomplished and discussing
      where the club is heading in the future. Like any other club,
      members come and members go but the club has never stopped growing.
      Since a club is as good as its members, I owe you all a debt
      of gratitude for your continued support and a <B><U>HUGE THANK
      YOU</U></B> for your never ending generosity. It has enabled
      me to keep the dues low so that everyone can join and has kept
      the sick turtle fund alive and well. I am glowing with gratitude
      and am prepared to continue for another 25 years! Shirley, can
      you manage the sale table for another 25 years? You&#146;re great!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We will have a special speaker
      for this special meeting. Her name is Linda Schooler and she
      has been a member of our club for many years, however, I was
      not aware of her extraordinary talents until recently. Linda
      is a pet psychic. She has been a professional psychic since 1987.
      In 1997 she added animal communication to her field of work after
      10 years as a volunteer pet therapy handler. Linda has been on
      TV and has had her own radio show and she was named best psychic
      in 2002 by the Sacramento News and Review.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As a psychic, Linda hopes to
      bring greater clarity and depth into a persons life. A &#145;reading&#146;
      can also include communication with those people or animals who
      have crossed over. As an animal communicator, Linda can help
      strengthen the bond between pet and person.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Linda has agreed to stay throughout
      the meeting and if you will bring a photo of your pet, she will
      do a reading and after meditating for a few seconds, will be
      able to restore understanding and communication between you and
      your pet. Arrangements can also be made for private readings
      at a later date. I may have to make an appointment to find out
      why my Greek tortoises act the way they do. Linda&#146;s website
      is: <A HREF="http://www.lindaschooler.com/">www.lindaschooler.com</A></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We&#146;ll be discussing coming
      out of hibernation problems and I do hope there aren&#146;t too
      many. If you bring your turtle or tortoise to the meeting, please
      keep it in a box and do not pass it around the room. We certainly
      do not want to spread any diseases.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
      YOU AT THE MEETING!</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Have we ever had a more horrible
      winter? My condolences to all who lost some of their turtles
      and tortoises during this hibernation period. As I type, it is
      a little over 40 degrees with record overnight lows. This would
      be normal in December and January but not in March! The trees
      are in blossom and the daffodils are up but the air has not been
      at all warm. We know better weather is ahead and personally,
      I can&#146;t wait. There&#146;s not much you can do for your
      outdoor turtles except hope for the best. The healthy ones will
      survive. The problem is - we never know until it&#146;s too late,
      if they were sick! Try not to kick yourselves if something bad
      happens. The truth is that most of the time the first symptom
      of illness in turtles is death.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you find baby box turtles
      or water turtles outside, it might be best not to bring them
      inside. They hatched out there, therefore, that&#146;s where
      they should remain. Make sure you keep them in a safe place so
      the birds do not eat them and you don&#146;t step on them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It has been a long cold winter
      in Sacramento. I am always sad when hibernation time arrives
      and then aggravated when there doesn&#146;t seem to be any end
      to it. I hope by the time this newsletter arrives in your mailbox,
      we&#146;ll be basking in the warm sun once more.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After many years of not seeing
      any predators, I awoke one morning in early January to see evidence
      that a visitor had been in the yard. My pond that contains only
      plants and minnows was in disarray and I feared the worst for
      the sliders in the covered &#145;adoption pond&#146; next to
      it. I tiptoed out, squinting, because I did not want to see any
      mutilated turtles. Unfortunately, many of the sliders were on
      their backs on the ground. One was dead. Strangely, the others
      were not seriously harmed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Knowing the predator would return,
      I set up my Havahart trap that night and also activated my Driveway
      Patrol. Everything was set and I decided to put the Driveway
      Patrol warning bell by my side of the bed upstairs because I
      didn&#146;t think I could hear it from the kitchen. For a month,
      this girl didn&#146;t get a full night&#146;s sleep. The alarm
      would go off several times during the night and I would leap
      up and run down the stairs into the cold kitchen and peer outside.
      Most of the time I could see a cat running along the fence line
      and I began to wonder what I would have done if I had seen a
      raccoon. Would I have run outside barefoot in a nightgown to
      confront it? Probably not, but I would certainly have made some
      noise to scare it off. Eventually I turned off the alarm although
      the trap remains to be set every night. It is nice to be able
      to sleep through the night without being jarred awake and the
      cat who sleeps on my bed appreciates it too.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty came out of her doghouse
      on March 11 and forecast 6 more weeks of winter. She is never
      wrong. This is very late for her to emerge. She sure knows what
      is going on weather wise. Joltin&#146; Joe, the very old Marginata
      is quite ill this winter and I&#146;m doing all I can to bring
      him back to health but it doesn&#146;t look good. I&#146;ve had
      him for so many years - I&#146;ll keep trying. The tortoises
      wintering in the greenhouse have done well. I&#146;ve noticed
      some mating going on which means they sense that Spring is on
      its way. All winter, they kind of hunker down on their Stanfield
      Heat Mat and don&#146;t do much except eat and excrete!! As soon
      as it gets a little warmer, they will be banging on the glass
      door to be let out. I secretly prefer them in the greenhouse
      because once they are out, I have to run around every night making
      sure they are in their shelters. I need a vacation...</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With Spring hopefully right around
      the corner, it will be a busy time for us all. So get out there
      and check the yard carefully. You want to mend any fences that
      the turtles can see through so get down to their level and take
      a look. You might be surprised to see the spaces you didn&#146;t
      know were there before. Winter rains do things like that. And
      if your turtles can see to the other side, you can bet that&#146;s
      where they will be heading ASAP. Check the yard for small white
      rocks that tortoises enjoy eating and dispose of them. Dangers
      are everywhere. BE ALERT!!</FONT></P>
