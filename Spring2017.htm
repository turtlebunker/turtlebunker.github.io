       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Our SPRING meeting will be held on
      Saturday, April 22, at the Belle Cooledge Library,  5600 South
      Land Park Drive, Sacramento, CA 95822 from 5 until we are all
      talked out.  Since most of you do not like the evening meetings,
      I would like you to arrive around 3-3:30  or so and we can meet
      at the gazebo in the park next to the library (if it is not taken)
      and you can bring your pets if you like so we can all enjoy seeing
      them, etc. and then at 5 we can go into the meeting room and
      have cake and discuss the upcoming meetings and plan a Turtlerama
      date and whatever you want to talk about.  (Pets are not allowed
      on the floor in the library so please keep them in a box that
      does not leak......)  We will also celebrate the club's 36th
      anniversary.  How do you like that?  And we keep gaining more
      and more members!    Those who need to leave early may do so
      at any time.  How does this sound to everybody?  I'm trying to
      please one and all!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The libraries are witholding
      their meeting rooms on Saturdays until 5 pm for their own activities
      and that is the reason we can no longer have afternoon meetings.
       Nobody can!  We are not being singled out!!  The kitchen at
      Belle Cooledge is still not available.......</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We can have our plant exchange,
      always fun to pick up something you have always wanted......and
      also donate your excess plants and cuttings, etc.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Winter meeting went well
      at Round Table Pizza.  It was not too crowded and we had a great
      time.  As always, all I ate was one slim piece of the Chicken
      Garlic pizza which is my favorite......and nothing else!  I'll
      bring and hide my own lunch next time.  I can't believe I didn't
      get even a crumb of the delicious cinnamon twists!!  I do need
      a body guard again to make sure I get a little bit of food? 
      I had to go to Jack in the Box afterwards for a meal!  I think
      the person who is eating most of the food is the same one who
      cut up the chocolate cake at our 27th club meeting with a knife
      they must have smuggled in and then during the meeting, doled
      out the Anniversary cake to the people sitting in the back of
      the room.  There were two small pieces left for the 25 people
      up front.  ????  WHO??? </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is FINALLY Spring again after
      an extremely wet winter with a broken Oroville dam adding to
      the nightmare of having a little TOO much rain.  We also had
      some pretty crazy winds with trees blowing over and doing a lot
      of damage.   I hope none of you sustained any damage or injuries.
       And now, it is time to clean up your yard because a lot of things
      happened over the winter.  Little rocks have come up which your
      tortoises will want to eat and all sorts of debris have blown
      into your yard.  Go through the yard for potential hazards. 
      Clean up pet hair (human hair too) You might have teens who like
      to dry their hair outdoors now that the weather is better.  Remove
      any trace of plastic bags, baggie ties, pins, needles and anything
      that can look like food to your tortoises.  It's an ongoing job,
      isn't it?  Watch for the turtles and tortoises also getting into
      situations they cannot free themselves from.  More than once
      I have seen one hanging by a claw on the little fence I have
      surrounding their enclosure because they just knew life would
      be much better on the other side.  Some never made it because
      I was not home to see them hanging - Heartbreaking!  SO BE ALERT!
       Try to imagine dangerous situation before they actually happen.
       Block those spaces under the fence so they won't be tempted
      to escape!!  If they can see out, you can be sure they will manage
      to dig out.  On the other hand, a neighbors dog might be tempted
      to dig into your yard and harm your pets.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">*Giovanni's, the pizza parlor
      down the street from the library, has renovated the restaurant
      and if anyone wants to go there and share a pizza after the meeting,
      that would be very nice.  It's all about eating!  I don't plan
      on bringing a large cake since a lot of you will head home before
      we actually go into the library room at 5.  Of course, we could
      bring one in if you prefer more privacy.</FONT></P>

       <BR>
      In the last newsletter I mentioned perhaps having someone come
      over to help now and then?  The Bunker is growing old, always
      overcrowded, always too much to do,  and I could use a friend
      to drop by and help clean the ponds and do some weeding and sprucing
      up.  Things I just don't have time for due to the amount of turtles
      and tortoises here which include mine and everyone else's!! 
      I did have helpers years ago.  But one brought a family along
      and one of the children walked into my screened patio room and
      saw a dollhouse we had just completed for a family member and
      immediately broke off the front porch among other things.  Another
      time a mother and son came by to help and I asked them to please
      pull the tall weeds that were growing near the back fence.  They
      did a great job, however, they did a little too much and opened
      up the area UNDER the fence so all of the box turtles who hang
      out back there had easy access to the neighbors yard.  So if
      anyone would enjoy being here and helping now and then, let me
      know.  It will be a terrific learning experience, I promise you.
       There are lots of laughs and also tragedies especially if we
      are 'raided' during the night.  I might even buy you lunch!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, I am glad to say goodbye
      to this very wet and cold winter.  I know this is not Boston,
      but I truly don't remember the winters being this way when we
      first moved here in 1971. Some of the residents are still in
      the greenhouse, including Blondie the big leopard and I don't
      force anyone to come out.  When they are ready, when I open the
      door to feed them, they simply walk out.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I've had very little information
      about the pond renovations going on at McKinley Park and also
      Land Park pond.   I don't think the work has even started at
      McKinley which is sad because the ducks and geese are hatching
      and their normal habitats there are unavailable to them.   I
      guess all of the turtles were removed somehow??  I WISH I had
      more information.  I know this tho, the baby turtles will be
      hatching any time now and I'm sure some of the turtles went into
      hibernation before anyone could take them away.  And I'm sure
      they will not be treated kindly by anyone finding them in or
      around the lake.  Nobody is going to stop and say,  what should
      we do with this turtle..........</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I don't have any stomach churning
      wounds to talk about (yet) not everyone is awake and ready to
      chase me causing me to fall and hurt myself.  I'm only concerned
      because there is a huge overload of big sliders here and I am
      really not equipped to give them a good home but they seem happy
      to just sit around the tiny pond doing nothing all day. Maybe
      I shouldn't feel bad?  These have come in from Animal Control
      and I do expect more as the weather warms.   There was a movie
      years ago called Who Will Love My Children.............and now
      I ask you, 'who will love my turtles'  altho they are not MINE,
      they are just here because that's the way it has to be!  I think
      my first newsletter mentioned them and when all is said and done,
      my last newsletter will say the same!!   Will YOU love my children???</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am sure a lot of you know how
      difficult it is to type when a huge cat is lying on your hands
      purring his brains out.  My wrists are so tired and a little
      punctured!!  I'm going to end this and just rubber stamp the
      rest!!   Thanks everyone for hanging in there with me as our
      turtle journey continues......</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I love every one of you more
      than you'll ever know.  Thanks for keeping me on my toes.  And
      to our Fabulous Facebook people, you guys are the best! </FONT>
