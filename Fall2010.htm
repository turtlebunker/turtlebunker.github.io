       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will be held on <B>Saturday,
      October 23rd </B>from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge Library,
      5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822. <B>Father Dimitri</B> will
      be conducting the pre-hibernation checkups, so please bring your
      pets along if you are not sure about their ability to hibernate
      successfully this winter. If your tortoise is already asleep,
      please do NOT wake it up and bring it to the meeting. Some will
      go into hibernation a little earlier if they suspect an extra
      cold winter so prepare to put more wood on the fire if yours
      is already asleep. Of course, some of you prefer to keep your
      pet awake and we can help you with that as well altho around
      Christmastime, you may wish he was hibernating and sparing you
      a lot of feeding, cleaning and worrying over whether he is eating
      enough. I know how stressful this time of year can be.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Since the meeting is so close
      to Halloween, feel free to dress your pet up for the occasion
      for a prize. There will be plenty of time for questions and answers
      and <B>Show and Tell</B>. I'm also planning a <B>wedding </B>for
      Just Jim Jr. and Suzi who recently became parents of quintuplets.
      (see back page) We did this for Clyde and Claire many years ago
      and I thought it would be appropriate to do it again for the
      new parents. I can't promise that Jim will be on his best behavior,
      but we can only hope he doesn't make a scene in front of everyone.
      I hope you can join in the festivities and have some wedding
      cake.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our <B>TURTLERAMA </B>was a huge
      success and the day flew by very quickly. Instead of being very
      hot and uncomfortable as a day in August can be, the day was
      cool, windy and overcast. There were wall to wall people from
      before we were officially 'open' until well after we ended the
      event. It was difficult to get out of the library before they
      locked the doors at 5 pm. It was also difficult for most of us
      to get up from our displays to look at what everyone else had
      brought. I got a few quick peeks and want to thank (as best as
      I can remember) the following people for spending the day exhibiting
      and talking to the public about how to care for turtles and tortoises
      and answering many outrageously funny questions. Many thanks
      to: Chris and Ernestine for doing the plaster paw castings again
      in the Children's Corner; Craig and Corrine, Michael, who had
      his beautiful Aldabra on display, Sara, Anakin and Pepper, Robin,
      Doug and Diane, Terra, Dan and Robin, Nancy, Elaine and her big
      Sulcata, Chuck and his wonderful sliders including some albinos,
      Suzanne, Sharon Jones, Joy Cornette (who will be making a tuxedo
      for Jim) Erica and Mary also with a large Sulcata. Both Sulcatas
      were named Sweet Pea, by the way. Thanks to Shirley for tirelessly
      working at the sale table along with Tracy &amp; Chase and thanks
      to Angie, Steve, Linda and others for the wonderful plants you
      brought. <B>GREAT JOB!!</B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">FALL HINTS and ADVICE: </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Please research to find out whether or
      not your turtle or tortoise naturally hibernates. The ones from
      Africa and South America do not and letting them sleep means
      you will never see them alive again. The non-hibernators include
      Redfoots, Yellowfoots, Leopards, Pancake tortoises, Hingebacks
      and Sulcatas. The ones who hibernate well are the Mediterranean
      species such as the Greeks and Hermann's and also the Russians.
      Box turtles, including theAsian species, do hibernate and do
      best outdoors all year but make sure you don't have a Florida
      box turtle. They do not hibernate. The Gulf Coast box turtles
      do extremely well in California, often seeking out water to sleep
      under perhaps to keep themselves as cold and wet as possible.
      Most water turtles successfully hibernate. Again, make sure you
      don't have an exotic species from a warm climate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you feel 'sorry' for your
      pet when that icy cold day comes along, please refrain from going
      outside and bringing it indoors. You'll kill it!! Stop and remember
      that they are wild animals and nobody brings them in from the
      wild and it is natural for them to sleep the winter away. If
      they had a good spring, summer and fall, they will do well all
      winter.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding predators which we
      all fear, check out the Halloween decorations that are out there
      now. You'll notice a lot of motion activated and pretty frightening
      creatures in the stores which can be used to scare off predators
      in your yard. I bought a wonderful snake which shook, hissed
      and its eyes lit up red at any movement. It scared lots of humans
      as well. I was attracted to it by some screams at Walgreens!!
      The snake lasted two years and then the day came when I turned
      it on and it began to shake and then it began to smoke and never
      worked again! Its lifeless body stands tall tho, guarding The
      Bunker.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Can anyone remember a colder
      summer? I don't know about you, but I never uncovered my house
      air conditioner. People had their electric blankets on in July
      and August and were wrapped in their Snuggies in the morning.
      Some were burning wood in their fireplaces! I was carrying in
      baby tortoises every night which I don't recall ever doing in
      previous years. Maybe now and then, but not every single night!
      As I type, we are having summer-like weather at the end of September.
      I love it and so do the tortoises and turtles. I don't want to
      hear anybody complain!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your turtles are not acting
      normally, it's due to the chilly summer. Blondie, the leopard
      tortoise, never did lay her August eggs. And now September is
      coming to a close and she didn't lay any this month either. A
      few times, she did appear to be making digging motions, so I
      carried her into the greenhouse so she could dig her nest in
      there and I wouldn't have to worry about her being outdoors all
      night long and fretting about a predator coming after her in
      that vulnerable position. Most times, she simply stopped her
      digging motions and went right to sleep. One time, however, she
      did complete a nest and around midnight, I noted that she was
      covering it up. So in the morning, in the intense heat inside
      the greenhouse, I began to dig with my little popsicle stick,
      I dug and dug, getting out perhaps a &frac14; of a teaspoon of
      dirt each time. After awhile, I came to realize that I was digging
      into an empty nest......</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I do have some rather startling
      news for you all. Those on <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">Facebook</A>
      already know. Just Jim Jr. has become the father of quintuplets!!
      They were born on September 1, exactly two months after the eggs
      were laid. The mom is a Greek tortoise Richard Speckner had given
      to me several years ago who was doing poorly. She did recover
      (her shell had become very soft) and she came back healthy and
      strong. Jim always goes after males of any species and any size
      but this spring I noticed him standing behind 'Suzi', perhaps
      thinking she was a male, a few times. When I saw Suzi nesting
      I was astonished and dug up the eggs and put them into the incubator
      but had no idea they would actually be fertile. So it was a very
      big surprise to see the hatchlings burst out of their eggs two
      months later. And they are so perfect! They were completely dry
      coming out of their eggs, no big yukky yolk sac or eggshell stuck
      to their faces, just clean and beautiful and hungry!! I never
      had Greek babies before and Jim has been here at least 20 years.
      I am smiling from ear to ear.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Last weekend, I received an email
      from my next door neighbor. I was not home that afternoon and
      she was quietly working in her yard. She began hearing a soft
      meowing coming from my side of the fence. It wouldn't stop. She
      became concerned since there has been a grey feral cat hanging
      around the neighborhood and she thought perhaps he was badly
      injured and lying there in pain. Or she thought it could be a
      kitten. She dragged a ladder over to the fence, climbed up and
      looked over and all she saw were two tortoises. No sick cat or
      kitten. When I was reading this note, I was a little concerned
      at first and thought I'd better go out and look but then the
      light bulb went off in my head and I started grinning and then
      burst out laughing. I know what that sound was. I hear it all
      of the time. It was Just Jim the JERK standing up in triumph
      behind one of the male leopards and squeaking loudly. The next
      day as I was rounding the corner, I could hear that sound again
      and this time I closed my eyes. Sure enough, it does sound like
      a kitten!! It's the only sound tortoises can make. A doggie squeeze
      toy makes the same sound. Try it, but do it slowly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By the way, a new terrorist has
      arrived At The Bunker. He is named appropriately, Brutus. He
      is a male Bell's Hingeback tortoise, about 7 inches long, very
      sleek looking, beautifully marked shell. But I believe he is
      suffering from PTSD. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You see,
      he has been in a classroom aquarium for WAY too long and now
      the sight of another tortoise sends him into a totally psychotic
      state with only murder and mayhem on his mind. He is in isolation
      and will be up for adoption soon, however, he MUST be an ONLY
      tortoise. He has even sent both Jim's running for their lives!!
      Now that is something!! Anyone interested?</FONT>
