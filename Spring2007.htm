       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our <B>Spring meeting</B> will be held
      on <B>Saturday, March 24th </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library
      from 1:30 until 4 . The library is located on the corner of Fruitridge
      Road and South Land Park Drive. <B>Linda Schooler, Pet Psychic</B>,
      will make a return visit and give a short presentation about
      what she does and then she will be available for private readings
      at the back of the room as the meeting continues. For your interest,
      when Linda was at our Spring 2006 meeting, she told club member,
      <B>Stu Kringer</B>, that he would be going to San Francisco in
      the near future. Stuart had no plans to go but a few weeks later,
      a friend called and said he had tickets to the S.F. Giants game
      and off he went. Isn't that something? Another guest will be
      <B>Lisa Burton</B>, from Benicia, and she has kindly offered
      to give us a very informative sea turtle slide presentation with
      plenty of time for questions and answers. Let's have a good turnout
      for our guests. We'll have lots of time for post-hibernation
      talk as well. Bring your questions!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Slumberama in January was
      well attended due to the nice weather. We had a lot to discuss
      about the cold weather and raccoons. Erin Andrew's mom, Judy,
      was visiting from Nevada and brought along her desert tortoise
      whose front leg had been bitten off by their Sulcata several
      months ago. The tortoise is doing fine but was not walking right,
      so Erin's dad, Jack, built a contraption for her to get around
      with which was attached to her plastron with a wheel where her
      leg would be. This enabled the tortoise to walk in a straight
      line. If anyone remembers, the original Just Jim was also missing
      a front leg but I didn't assist him in any way because he seemed
      to get around just fine. But it was the clunking of his shell
      on the ground that was rather eerie. Clunk, pause, Clunk, pause,
      Clunk, pause, Clunk, pause and then there was the clack clacking
      of him mounting anything that had a turtle shape, dead or alive.<BR>

      GRAVEL IMPACTION IN EIGHT HATCHLING CALIFORNIA DESERT TORTOISES<BR>
      By Walter J. Rosskopf DVM *</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
      Several months ago, I was presented with a tragic case. A hatchling
      Gopherus agassizii (6 months old) died suddenly and several others
      in a group of eight were lethargic and not eating. As is standard
      procedure in a case like this, the dead hatchling was immediately
      autopsied to determine the cause of death. The hatchling appeared
      basically normal but was solidly impacted from stomach to rectum
      with coarse aquarium gravel! Needless to say, the little animal
      had not been able to pass this material and had died from inanition
      and shock.<BR>
<BR>
      The other hatchlings were immediately arranged on an X-ray plate
      with tape markings placed on each to help differentiate them.
      The resulting radiograph showed that all were loaded with gravel,
      altho none as bad as the one that had died. Each hatchling was
      given a mineral oil enema with an eyedropper and an oral dose
      of several drops of mineral oil. The owner was instructed to
      take them off gravel, put them on dirt and to give mineral oil
      daily. Over the next few days, they began to pass a large amount
      of gravel. Several radiographs over the next few weeks showed
      that all were passing the gravel and all the remaining hatchlings
      eventually improved in condition and recovered. The final radiograph
      taken one month later showed them to be free of gravel and in
      good condition.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>DISCUSSION:</B> It is common practice to house hatchlings
      on sand or gravel. The above case illustrates why this is not
      a good idea as ingestion of food includes too many gravel or
      sand particles. Ranchers have faced this problem for years in
      horses fed on sand with resulting &quot;sand colic&quot;. Also,
      I have seen the eyes on many hatchlings ruined by contamination
      with sand with infection and blindness resulting. I recommend
      that all hatchlings be kept on dirt for this reason. The final
      Los Angeles County veterinary pathology report showed that the
      dead hatchling had indeed died of impaction with no other internal
      problems. Tortoise fanciers should be extremely careful in their
      housing of Gopherus agassizii hatchlings.</FONT></P>

      As I write this near the end of February, the icy nights continue
      after a brief warming trend. I am hoping that you have left your
      turtles outside to continue their hibernation instead of rushing
      them inside thinking it was too cold for them. It's always a
      mistake to do that (unless the turtle is obviously sick). The
      right thing to do is add extra coverings to their outdoor hibernation
      areas. Turtles know how to survive. I had an interesting letter
      from someone in New England saying that a red eared slider had
      come onto her property and decided to lay her eggs but dug the
      hole too deep, over 12&quot;, and she added that the mother must
      have been new at it. I wrote back and told her that the mother
      turtle was very experienced and by digging the nest extra deep,
      she was ensuring her babies survival knowing how cold it would
      be in the winter months. They were deep enough to hatch and hibernate
      safely until spring. Of course, they were not allowed to do that
      because after 100 days in the ground, the people dug up the eggs.
      They had hatched but not all survived the human interruption!!<BR>
<BR>
      Back to The Bunker, after the last newsletter, things worsened
      around here regarding the raccoon. The alarm was going off by
      my pillow every night and I was running downstairs to look out
      of the back door to see what was there. If the <I>Driveway Patrol</I>
      rang 3 times and then stopped, I knew it was a passing cat. However,
      if it kept on ringing, I knew that the raccoon had returned.
      He came back every single night and I was able to scare him off
      each time. Who wouldn't be scared at the sight of a wild woman
      in her nightgown in the middle of the night, in curlers with
      cold cream on her face running out of the door yelling '<B>GET
      OUT OF HERE</B>' while brandishing a BB gun? (Is this the reason
      my neighbors have been avoiding me?)<BR>
<BR>
      After toying with the idea of getting a dog, I knew I'd just
      be adding to my problem. I was not getting any sleep with this
      alarm going off all of the time and I certainly had to investigate
      or face waking up to a yard full of mutilated turtles. I remembered
      seeing a motion sensor once, meant for people living alone, to
      let burglars know that there was a dog inside. I searched the
      Internet and found the product I wanted. <B>REX PLUS</B>, the
      electronic watchdog. I ordered it immediately and it was delivered
      quickly. I set it up outside. The Driveway Patrol went off a
      few nights in a row but I never saw the raccoon again. I am absolutely
      certain that the barking dog sent him packing, never to return.
      I am going to order another one to put near my pond which is
      in an unprotected area of the yard. I feel it's important to
      use the Driveway Patrol in conjunction with Rex Plus because
      the range is longer and you will know something is in the yard.
      I bought it from <A HREF="http://ddsp.com/shopsite_sc/shopping_cart/ref.cgi?storeid=*16fce88ea18b60d906a7a54e5f&name=Felice_Rood">D&amp;D

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The leopard tortoise eggs are
      still in the dresser drawer. I had to put them into the incubator
      for several days when I had company sleeping in that bedroom,
      and I don't think the move affected them in any way. I'll let
      you know in the next newsletter. The eggs look very white and
      beautiful. Meanwhile, Blondie and her boyfriends are so anxious
      to get out of the Greenhouse. Fat Betty is not yet awake so they
      will have to wait awhile longer. However, the trees are beginning
      to bloom and a new season is about to begin. I hope all of your
      turtles and tortoises had a healthy hibernation. Check their
      eyes and noses, give them a drink and keep your fingers crossed.</FONT></P>
