       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> -  Our next meeting will be held on<B>
      JULY 17th</B>, at the newly renovated Belle Cooledge Library,
       5600 South Land Park Drive,  95822 from 1:30 until 4.  If you
      were at the Slumberama in January, you would have heard me announce
      that I had good news and bad news.  The good news was that I
      had secured <B>July 17th</B> for our summer meeting and<B> August
      21st</B> for our <B>Turtlerama</B>.  The bad news was that the
      library would be closed all of March, April and May leaving all
      of the organizations who use the room, without a meeting place.
       So our 29th anniversary celebration will have to wait until
      July and believe me, I will be guarding our cake!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the winter meeting, <B>Chase</B>
      won top prize for her dessert which was a cheesecake and I thank
      you all for your participation and wonderful cookies, etc.  The
      meeting was well attended and we had quite an extensive question
      and answer period.  It started out badly tho since the library
      didn't open that day until 1 pm for some unknown reason and we
      were all standing outside freezing in the cold and damp air.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm beginning to write this newsletter
      in early March.  Winter is still raging outside with fog, cold,
      wind, rain and even hail and lightening!  The gloom arrived in
      December and has been relentless.  There have been no balmy or
      even sunny days.  I've lived here since 1971 and cannot remember
      a worse winter.  I thought I was back in New York!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Let's thank Elaine Martinez for
      going to the F&amp;G meeting in February to say something about
      stopping the turtles from coming into California for the food
      trade.  The F&amp;G is contemplating doing something about it,
      but I'm not sure when or what.  I heard that the markets would
      be required to post a sign saying that the turtles must not be
      released into the wild. They may have stopped issuing permits
      to sell the turtles in the first place.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Anyway, it's too early to say
      'see you at the meeting', so I'll just tell you to call me, email
      me or go to our <B><A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">FACEBOOK</A>
      </B>page for up to date happenings or for help with turtle problems.
       I'm sorry about not having a meeting but nothing we had in mind
      seemed to work.</FONT></P>

      <B>Spring Idea:</B>  How about growing your own mealworms?  All
      you need is a plastic container with high sides.  I usually have
      several of them going at once in case one suffers a catastrophe.
        Buy some plain 'bran' at the supermarket (in the cereal aisle)
      and fill the container a little over half full.  Buy a couple
      of packs of mealworms and put them in there.  Every few days,
      cut a raw potato into thin slices and place it on top of the
      bran.  Pretty soon you'll notice beetles and also pupae in there
      as the mealworms morph into other life forms and soon you will
      have more mealworms than you ever dreamed of.  Leave the old
      potatoes in as well because the little mealworms hide in them
      and also there could be eggs buried in them.  It's very interesting.
       I keep mine on the screened patio.  Weather doesn't bother them
      but keep it dry.   Have Fun.....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is finally warmer and almost
      everyone has come out of hibernation.  I am very surprised to
      see 99% of the turtles and tortoises made it through the most
      severe winter I can remember.  Even the newborn sliders survived.
       Believe me, when the temperatures dipped into the low 20's,
      I regretted leaving them outside.  I'm always kicking myself
      for one reason or another.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim the Jerk and Just Jim
      Jr. were very late waking up this year.  I was worried that they
      didn't make it through.  They must have dug down deeper due to
      the weather and a few other Greeks and Hermann's appeared much
      later than usual and I was very happy to see them.    Francois
      has come up.  He's the Gulf Coast box turtle who will drown the
      females if the water dishes are too full;  and my original box
      turtles, Roger, Rita and Mr. Ed, the Redhead, have also emerged
      in good shape.  The little pond turtle who almost drowned a few
      years ago is doing well.  I never put her back into the regular
      pond because I didn't think it was safe.  So she lives with the
      smaller sliders and mud and musk turtles.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A bunch of Blondie's &amp; Tarzan's
      babies have hatched (Leopard tortoises) and will be for sale
      in the near future.  Please email if interested, but I do not
      want to mail them anywhere.  Blondie and her buddies in the greenhouse
      are anxious to get out of there and enjoy the sunshine and fresh
      grass again.  Speaking of her buddies, the warmer temperatures
      have awakened them in different ways.  James, the ankle biter,
      has suddenly taken a great interest in Darwin, the deformed leopard
      who almost lost her life by freezing to death last winter.  Often,
      however, he is not mounting her in the right part of her body
      and Chester, the ancient Elongata, becomes a nuisance, sort of
      the equivalent of a Peeping Tom, hanging around and also doing
      a bit of shoving!  He is always let out of the greenhouse earlier
      than the others and by the time you receive this newsletter,
      he'll be out patrolling the yard again.</FONT></P>

      Bunker</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">...........Dear
      Felice - OK, so nothing exciting at the Connecticut Bunker Outpost
      this past summer.  Some random egg-laying, some random egg-blocking
      (which turned into some not so random poo), oh and let's not
      forget the planned escape of Clyde Henderson, the male Bell's
      Hingeback tortoise.  Two years ago, Clyde bit off the tip of
      Lieuzerne's nose (Home's Hingeback, male, a force to be reckoned
      with) so he's been in solitary when outdoors.  But I guess he
      either grew wings or climbed out and is lost.  This was the story
      of his life - having escaped 20 years ago in Cape Cod and being
      found by an elderly woman.  Hopefully his guardian angel will
      find him again.  Some say he's been spotted in New York at various
      deli's wielding a knife at people but I don't know.  DuGrande,
      the female Turkish Spur-Thigh celebrated her 14th birthday in
      July and Spaghetti, the female Jordanian Spur-Thigh, also celebrated
      her 14th birthday on Christmas.  Her father, Dr. Goggles, is
      rumored to be returning to Yale as a surgeon this year.  Take
      Care..........Diane  </FONT></P>

      </FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Coming out of hibernation
      in Sacramento seems to coincide with changeable weather, so to
      be on the safe side, don't let your desert tortoise sleep outdoors
      until the weather is drier and the lawns are not so wet in the
      mornings.  If you must let it stay outdoors, be sure that the
      sleeping quarters are dry, dry, dry and protected from wind and
      rain and make sure the tortoise is in the shelter at night because
      that's when the predators come calling.  </FONT></P>
