      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Can you believe it? It's our
      19th year!! And the club is better than ever thanks to all of
      you out there. Our Spring meeting will be held on Saturday, April
      15th at the Belle Cooledge Library located on the corner of South
      Land Park and Fruitridge Road from 1:30 until 4 pm. Chad Inks
      has said he'd like to be our guest speaker and he has been doing
      extensive work with map turtles and would like to present a program
      about them. Let's have a great turnout for Chad. <BR>
<BR>
      I have some of the Tortoise Trust videotapes and plan on showing
      them when we do not have a guest speaker. Since the library personnel
      refuse to let us use the TV/VCR which I thought was for public
      library use, we have no choice but to bring our own. We need
      2 TV sets and one VCR and we can hook them together so that the
      people in the back of the room will be able to see the video
      also. I have two 13 inch TV sets and a VCR but considering the
      amount of items I load into my car for the meetings, I'm asking
      for your help so that I don't have to rent a U-Haul. Please let
      me know if you have this equipment or even the larger unit and
      can help with this. NOTE: At the Reno TurToise Club meetings,
      the library personnel cheerfully wheel the TV/VCR combo into
      the meeting room. <BR>
<BR>
      Bring your pets for show and tell. We'll have a raffle and an
      auction and feel free to donate turtle items, new or gently used,
      to the club as a fund raiser. It is all very much appreciated
      and to those who have donated so many lovely items we cannot
      ever thank you enough! <BR>
<BR>
      Harold and Naoma Carty, Chowchilla Turtle Breeders, regret that
      they cannot attend this meeting but feel free to call them at
      1-559-665-2436 (note new area code) to check on current hatchlings.
      We'll miss you and hope you can be here for the Turtlerama on
      July 22.<BR>

      Our mid-winter slumber party was great. The room was crowded
      with enthusiastic turtle owners and the day was sunny. Dave Roberts
      gave us a very informative lecture about his Sulcata tortoises
      and there was an extensive question and answer period afterwards.
      The love Dave has for his tortoises is wonderful to see and he
      does have concerns about people buying Sulcata hatchlings without
      knowing how large they grow in a short period of time and do
      not hibernate. Since the meeting, many more people have emailed
      me regarding the fact that they have just acquired a baby Sulcata
      and what can they expect in the future. I have to tell them the
      truth. The tortoise will always be cute but it won't stay small
      for long. Most people are ill-equipped to care for Sulcatas when
      they grow larger. Thank you, Dave. We appreciated your talk.<BR>
<BR>
      Since almost everyone enjoyed the TURTLERAMA last July, we decided
      to do it again this year and the date will be on July 22. Please
      sign up at this coming meeting and I will call you to confirm
      matters as the date draws closer and I really appreciate your
      participation in this important event. I know it is an exhausting
      experience but well worth the effort.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SEE YOU AT THE MEETING!!</B></FONT></P>

      Spring Hints:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Closely
      inspect your yard. Winter rains bring little rocks to the surface
      and we all know how tortoises love to eat little rocks. Clean
      up debris including hair (human and pet), baggie ties, pieces
      of plastic and foam, bits of foil, paper clips, broken flower
      pots, pool nets. All of these things can cause injury and death
      if eaten or walked on or tangled in. Keep Bermuda grass clipped
      short because tortoises do not know enough to back out of a snag.
      Provide plenty of hiding spots so that your pet will feel secure
      and will be able to quickly escape the hot sun or a predator
      or the aggressiveness of another turtle or tortoise. Keep one
      step ahead of your tortoise in order to keep him safe from harm.</FONT></P>

      It was February 2nd. Quite a lovely winter day. I was on my knees
      digging up weeds by The Greenhouse. I saw something out of the
      corner of my eye. I turned thinking it was the cat. It wasn't.
      It was a female Hermann's tortoise coming towards me with mud
      clogs on her back and she paused for a moment to look up at me
      and it was as if she were saying, &quot;Is it spring yet?&quot;<BR>
      And I said to her, &quot;What are you, a groundhog?&quot; And
      she continued on to an unknown destination. Several others were
      also awake that day and it was good to see my friends again.<BR>
<BR>
      The Bunker is a busy place now that the warmer weather is settling
      in. The exotics are happy to be released into the yard to enjoy
      their lives in relative freedom after being stuck inside of The
      Greenhouse all winter. They seem to know when it is time to go
      out into the yard because they are very quiet during the winter
      months, never leaving the comfort of the Stanfield heat pad,
      but in February, they start pacing the perimeter and when I open
      the door to bring in their food, Clyde and Fernando are the first
      ones to quickly climb over the doorsill and start running to
      their favorite spots in the yard, never forgetting that food
      magically appears by the patio door. The trick is to find them
      to put them inside later on because it's too cold at night in
      February to stay outside. <BR>
<BR>
      Many of the box turtles stayed awake this winter. They were not
      eating but seemed to be fine. The temperature never got cold
      enough for them. Others tried to hibernate by going into the
      pond with the water turtles and this seemed to help. One turtle,
      Strawberry, surprised me by actually swimming very gracefully
      under the water. I still do not believe what I saw. The three
      &quot;dryer&quot; turtles which I will never live down seem to
      be doing beautifully. They are hungry little guys and I do give
      them extra treats to make up for their rather hot and shaky start
      in life. <BR>
<BR>
      Turtles won't eat? Try playing music for them. I keep hatchlings
      in an upstairs bedroom. My keyboard is also in that room and
      when I play late at night, the tortoises always come out and
      start eating. As an experiment, I often keep the room dark. It
      doesn't matter. They want their midnight snack. Do they hear
      the music? Obviously, yes! And they are not fussy either. Bach
      or Rock will spark their appetites.</FONT></P>

      (What Would Just Jim Do)</B><BR>
<BR>
      Suppose you catch your neighbor spraying poison onto his trees
      and on his home? Do you panic? YES! The fumes will drift into
      your yard and can be deadly to your water turtles because the
      pesticides lay on the surface of the water and the turtles absorb
      it and do not survive. Your box turtles will burrow into pesticide
      laced holes and your tortoises will eat the poisoned grass.<BR>
<BR>
      Promptly hose down your yard and trees thoroughly. When you think
      you are done, do it again. Then go over and have a little talk
      with the neighbor or the extermination company doing the spraying.
      You may be surprised at how agreeable these people might be.
      Thank them profusely. In the event you are met with opposition,
      you should inform your neighbor that your yard is a &quot;Fish
      and Game Wildlife Sanctuary&quot; and that there is a fine for
      harming the wildlife in your yard. This should do the trick.
      Protect your pets. And yourself too.</FONT></P>

      We want to thank <I>PRETTY BIRD</I> and <I>ZOO MED</I> for donating
      items for our raffle table. Please check out the products displayed
      at the meeting and also their other products available in pet
      shops. None of our local pet shops has responded to my plea for
      a small donation of any kind. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>TURTLE FABRIC ANYONE? </B>I'm always looking for interesting
      turtle fabric in order to create items to sell at the meetings
      as fundraisers. Please consider donating extra turtle fabric,
      even small pieces will be ok, to the club. Want to sell it? We'll
      negotiate.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GET YOUR INCUBATORS READY.</B> I know it is going to be a
      very fertile season considering the mild winter and early spring.
      Sometimes box turtles will lay eggs three times in one season.
      Most tortoises will lay two clutches about a month apart. The
      box turtles will also dig nests one month apart. Water turtles
      will nest one to three times in a season. Exotics will dig nests
      at any time since they are all out of their native habitats.
      BE PREPARED!! It is better to have the incubator stabilized for
      a week before putting the eggs into it and not plugging it in
      when the eggs are being laid.</FONT></P>
