      </FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting will be held
      on Saturday, October 16th from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library. The library is located on the corner of South Land Park
      and Fruitridge Road off of I-5. This will be our annual pot-luck
      meeting so bring your favorite snack to share and please try
      to remember to help clean up afterwards. Thank you so much for
      that. Hibernation will be our main topic and Father Dimitri is
      going to be on hand to perform the pre-hibernation checkups.
      Feel free to bring your turtle or tortoise to the meeting, however,
      we beg you not to pass your pet around the room, but allow others
      to observe it without actually touching it. No hugging or kissing,
      ok? Of course, if it&#146;s another person, that&#146;s perfectly
      fine!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I&#146;m certain that many of
      you have expected and unexpected hatchlings and many questions
      as well. We&#146;ll be happy to answer as many as possible and
      please give us your input on this subject if you have had successes
      in the past and even if there have been disasters. It&#146;s
      the only way we can learn, from our unfortunate mistakes. There
      will probably be hatchlings of various species for sale at the
      meeting so be sure to take a care sheet to help you care for
      it and it is never a bad idea to buy several, just in case!!
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Turtlerama was a HUGE success.
      It seems to get better and better each year and it is due to
      all of you who brought your turtles and tortoises to display
      in wonderful habitats and stayed all day long answering hundreds
      of questions. We had a great assortment of turtles and tortoises
      to show the public. Gary and Ginger Wilfong arrived from Castro
      Valley (Bay Area Turtle and Tortoise Rescue) with some huge Sulcatas
      which was wonderful because we hope people will resist buying
      the &quot;cute little hatchlings&quot; after seeing how big and
      aggressive some of these tortoises become. The unsuspecting public
      really has to be aware of what lies ahead especially since the
      African species do not hibernate and cannot get chilled. It would
      be like keeping a cow in your warm house all winter. Not good!!
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had a huge amount of wonderful
      plants donated and although I know most came from Angie and Linda,
      I don&#146;t know who else donated but the club is very appreciative
      of your kind donation. The money from the sale went into the
      Sick Turtle Fund as does all extra dues, etc. Not all of the
      plants sold. The rest of them are on my front porch so if there
      were any you were interested in - it may not be too late after
      all!! <B><I><U>SEE YOU AT THE MEETING!! </U></I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fall Hints</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> - Since I have had several phone calls
      on this subject, I thought I would reprint an article from Ellen
      Nicol which appeared in the Feb/March 1990 issue of The Carapace,
      newsletter of the National Turtle and Tortoise Society, Inc.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;If a prematurely-hatched
      turtle or tortoise has a very large sac, do your best to keep
      the sac intact, mainly by keeping the baby quiet to prevent it
      from walking around and possibly tearing the sac. The yolk is
      not only necessary nourishment for the hatchling, but there is
      a system of blood vessels throughout the yolk, connected with
      the turtle. If the sac is punctured and the yolk runs or squeezes
      out, blood circulation is disrupted between the hatchling and
      the sac, almost always resulting in death of the infant. Don&#146;t
      be impatient to open eggs early, even if the time of incubation
      seems right for the species. Rapid development takes place right
      at the end of incubation, and even two weeks can make a difference
      between a normal healthy baby, and one too small to survive,
      being deprived of its final weeks in the shell.&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This time, Blondie, the Leopard
      tortoise laid 9 eggs on September 11. If you remember, on Sept.
      11, 2001, another leopard had laid eggs. I guess I have some
      very patriotic tortoises living here. The original 9/11/01 eggs
      did not hatch. The health of the mother was questionable, but
      I am hopeful that Blondie&#146;s eggs will hatch around February
      12th. If not, then most certainly on Washington&#146;s birthday
      which is February 22 or &quot;President&#146;s Day&quot;, the
      21st. I will let you know and once they are eating, they will
      be for sale. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I failed to mention in our last
      newsletter the fact that on one of my nightly patrols to make
      sure everyone was ok, I stepped over the little fence leading
      into the Reeves enclosure and heard a &#145;crunch&#146;. In
      the darkness, it appeared that I had stepped on some white rocks.
      I went in and got a flashlight. (I didn&#146;t remember any white
      rocks there before!) DARN! I had stepped on and broken two eggs.
      There were 3 in the nest which was barely covered and these two
      were sitting on the top, like decoys, and if I had not stepped
      on them, I&#146;m sure in the morning the blue jays would have
      enjoyed eating them as well as the ones in the exposed nest.
      I dug out the other three and incubated them in a clay flower
      pot filled with damp green moss. Two adorable babies emerged
      two weeks ago. The third egg was empty. I&#146;m glad I didn&#146;t
      kill them all.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker has been busy, as
      it always is in the summertime, fielding phone calls, emails,
      snail mails, entertaining visitors and waiting for them to ask
      me how many turtles I have (does it really matter?), healing
      the sick and injured and consoling the bereaved not to mention
      getting ready for the Turtlerama! No small task. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty is still quite active
      in mid-September which means there is plenty of good weather
      ahead. She has many friends these days due to the fact that Petco
      was selling them to folks who had no clue as to what they were
      buying. They soon realized that these guys can emit some really
      smelly poo which they do profusely when unhappy indoors, plunked
      into an aquarium as per pet shop employee instructions. I have
      found suitable outdoor homes for most of them. Paula Morris appropriately
      calls them &quot;The Fecal People&quot;. Indoors, it&#146;s true.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Of course, the African Sulcatas
      are worth mentioning. They regularly are turned in for adoption.
      One has been here for two years and is starting to grow a bit
      too large and has turned into a dog in a way. He follows me around
      the yard and will nip at my ankles letting me know he is there
      and is hungry. He stations himself in a doghouse close to the
      back porch feeding area so he can lumber out whenever food magically
      appears. I try not to have favorites, but he is stealing my heart.
      He does have a new home but their yard is not quite ready. I
      will miss my buddy when he leaves. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A desert tortoise was here for
      awhile and I put him into the Greenhouse because he was bullying
      the other tortoises. He immediately reverted to his wild behavior
      and dug a large burrow. He dug under the Greenhouse footings
      and ended up in the new secure pond area. Before I knew it, several
      sliders made their way into the hole and came out in the Greenhouse.
      A male Greek, also in the Greenhouse for being fresh ended up
      basking by the side of the pool with the sliders. When I saw
      that, I froze. I could not imagine how he got there until I inspected
      the burrow. The pond area is heavily planted so I could not see
      what had obviously happened. Such is life At The Bunker. Every
      day brings a new challenge.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the last newsletter, I made
      an error regarding red eared sliders and water turtles in general.
      I had said that they sometimes turn into &#145;carnivores&#146;
      if a box turtle or a sick turtle is in the pond. The word I meant
      to use was &quot;cannibals&quot;. **************************</FONT></P>
