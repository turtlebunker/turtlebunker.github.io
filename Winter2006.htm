       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Slumberama (Winter meeting) will
      be held on Saturday, January 20th from approximately 1:30 until
      4 at the Belle Cooledge Library located on the corner of Fruitridge
      Road and South Land Park Drive. If the weather is very rainy
      or foggy, we'll call it off and if you are in doubt, please give
      me a call. Please notice a year's worth of confirmed meeting
      dates listed above. When I went into the library in October to
      book our April meeting, I was told that all Saturdays in April
      AND May were already taken. I expressed my dismay since this
      goes against the library's 6 month policy regarding securing
      the meeting room which I have been obediently following from
      day one. I was forced to take March 24th for our Spring meeting.
      I then requested all of the above dates through next January
      and, as a favor, they were given to us. So for now, we are all
      set.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had a great time at the October
      meeting. Father Dimitri gave the final word on whether or not
      your turtles or tortoises were healthy enough to hibernate. Thank
      you so much for donating your time for a good cause! There was
      quite an array if delightful snacks you all brought including
      several turtle-shaped foods. My favorite was the bread bowl containing
      a spinach dip created by Ron &amp; Lynn Petersen. It had a head,
      legs and a tail and when you lifted up the top part of the bread,
      there was the dip. Great Job! There were also several turtles
      dressed up in their Halloween costumes which we enjoyed viewing.
      You are all so creative!<BR>

      Linda Schooler, Pet Psychic, cannot make it to this meeting but
      has promised to be at our March 24th meeting and will give a
      presentation on what she does and also give private readings
      at the back of the room during the rest of the meeting. And that
      brings us to the January meeting. It's called the Slumberama
      because there's not much happening in the middle of January.
      Bring your turtle and tortoise questions to the meeting and we'll
      try to answer them. It is never easy getting through the winter
      months. I'll include some tips at the bottom of this page. Also,
      we could use more raffle items, so consider re-gifting those
      unwanted Christmas presents! I hope the weather behaves and we
      can get together.<BR>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> - if anyone is basking all night, that
      could be a problem. Turtles normally go under cover when the
      sun goes down so they are safe from predators. Sitting out is
      a way of causing their own demise when they are sick. They certainly
      know how to live and die.<BR>
      Outdoor tortoises - keep an eye out for any tortoises who decide
      to come out and bask. Quite often they become too chilled and
      don't go back into their shelters. It does not mean they are
      sick. Put them back and if they continue to come out and not
      go back into their houses, then you might consider bringing them
      indoors slowly. It's simply impossible to know what to do!! If
      the pet feels very light, then by all means, end the hibernation.
      The same goes for a runny nose and swollen eyes. If you have
      pairs of turtles and tortoises, always watch for hatchlings on
      the lawn. They hatch unexpectedly, especially after a winter
      rain, and are easily stepped on. The low sun makes them easier
      to see.<BR>
<BR>
      Indoor turtles and tortoises may eat less and sleep a lot. You
      could allow them to go dormant for 6 to 8 weeks without harm.
      By Valentine's Day, everything will start returning to normal.</FONT></P>

      It is winter and not a creature is stirring except for the Greek
      tortoises who think icy cold nights are just fine and coming
      out to bask and even eat in the morning sunshine is an ok thing
      to do. They have great doghouses to sleep in but most nights
      I discover them either sleeping by the cactus or in the soggy
      bog with the box turtles. A few Russians also entered the bog
      and I had no idea they were there until we had some heavy rain
      and there they were, covered in mud, trying to climb out of the
      mess they had gotten themselves into. Fat Betty was not included
      because she is far more sophisticated than that. She is snugly
      in her doghouse sleeping away the winter.<BR>
<BR>
      As always, plenty of sliders have come in for adoption. The reasons
      for giving them away are always the same. They have outgrown
      their aquarium (where they never should have been in the first
      place), or they smell or the child who owned it grew up and left
      and nobody wants to take care of it or best of all, they are
      moving. No turtle has ever been turned over to me that lives
      in an outdoor pond. Not one. The last slider was delivered missing
      all of her legs thanks to a raccoon attack. She's doing nicely
      in my utility sink in the laundry room. Is anyone interested
      in adopting her? She'll need special care and should not be with
      other turtles. They probably would kill her. That's what turtles
      do if given the opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
      There are leopard tortoises hatching and I also have a new cat
      who adopted me who is quite frisky and curious and likes to play
      with toy mice. He obviously thinks the baby leopards are mice
      because I have caught him carefully reaching into the screened
      container and slowly lifting one of the babies out and begin
      playing with it. I made a new container for them with an even
      tighter lid and the next thing I knew, the entire container was
      upside down. This is not good! Next step is putting them into
      a closet and locking the door!!<BR>

      About 4 weeks ago, I noticed Blondie the Leopard, pacing in the
      greenhouse again. I knew egg laying was fast approaching. This
      would be her third clutch since August. Luckily, she managed
      to lay the 11 eggs quickly and I was able to dig them up (not
      in my nightgown this time) by midnight. I carried the eggs to
      the kitchen sink and carefully washed them off with lukewarm
      water. I don't know if it is the correct thing to do, but I like
      them clean so I can see if they are fertile or not. When they
      were clean, I put them into a tray and then realized there was
      no more room in the incubator since Clutch #1 (10 eggs) and Clutch
      #2 (11 eggs) were in there. I walked from room to room. &quot;What
      do normal people do at night&quot;, I wondered. At some point
      I realized that there was an empty drawer in a dresser in an
      upstairs bedroom. And that became my new incubator. I put a hot
      rock in with the eggs and closed the drawer. PERFECT!! I had
      inadvertently discovered a wonderful place for incubating eggs.
      It is staying at a comfortable 90 degrees which means the hatchlings
      may turn out to be females for a change. Time will tell.<BR>
<BR>
      Two nights before Christmas, I went out to check the yard around
      8 pm and was so upset to see about 20 box turtles lying upside
      down in their habitat, obviously dug out of the bog and other
      hibernation spots. All were tightly closed up. I assumed a raccoon
      had come to visit. Perhaps more than one. Even the fake turtles
      were upside down!! My Havahart trap was on the front porch because
      the day before, my small goldfish had been taken from the little
      pond and I suspected it might be a predator. Obviously, I was
      right. I have two traps set up in the back yard now and am once
      again sleeping with the Driveway Patrol alarm on my pillow. (Yes
      it is time for the funny farm) With luck, they were just passing
      through and won't be back.<BR>
<BR>
      Thank you all for your wonderful holiday cards and good wishes
      and extra dues. It is all greatly appreciated more than you will
      ever know. I do wish you all a Happy and Healthy and Prosperous
      2007.<BR>
