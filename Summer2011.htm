       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Instead of our summer meeting, we'll
      have our <B>TURTLERAMA</B> on <B>July 16th</B> at the Belle Cooledge
      Library, 5600 South Land Park Drive 95822 from 11 until 4.  At
      the Spring meeting, many of you kindly signed up to either exhibit
      or help help that day.  Can you please email me or phone to confirm
      that you will still be able to help?  Thanks a bunch.  The more
      exhibits we have, the better the show will be.  Please consider
      bringing your pet, even if you cannot stay the entire day, in
      order to help other people take care of their pets properly.
       Our biggest enemy these days is the 'Internet' and all of the
      absolutely terrible information available which is so harmful
      and completely stupid.  We have to keep getting out the correct
      advice.  The future of all turtles depends on us and other clubs
      devoted to saving these creatures for the next generation before
      they are all gone.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This will be our<B> 30th TURTLERAMA
      </B>and the best one ever.  The 'real' Just Jim and Suzi will
      be on hand to help you if you need any assistance setting up
      or breaking down displays or need anything.  There are always
      snacks and drinks in the meeting room kitchen for our exhibitors.
       Don't hesitate to ask or have someone sit in for you while you
      take a break.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting was terrific.
       I really love how crowded our meetings are and how much fun!
       There's always something interesting and informative going on
      and lots to snack on and drink.   I brought Chester, my old Elongata
      to the meeting since I've had him about 30 years and he was old
      when he arrived.  He didn't hesitate to demonstrate what he had
      done in a nursing home many years ago to the delight and disgust
      of all present.  It depends on your attitude.  We can always
      count on Chester to do something gross with very little provocation.
       No cake was harmed during the meeting!!  Thanks to one and all
      for being there.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Often, a box turtle's eyes seem
      to be sealed shut.  Before calling a vet, give the turtle the<BR>
      &quot;AQUA-TREATMENT&quot;.  Simply keep the turtle in shallow
      water, up to its nose, for 24 to 48 hours.  Most of the time,
      they are dehydrated and certainly don't need any antibiotics
      for that.  Water is the secret remedy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With all species, if only one
      eye is closed, this usually means that the turtle has an injury
      or an irritation from rubbing it.  If both eyes are closed and
      swollen, the turtle could be sick.  Soak as above for a few days
      and also apply some ophthalmic ointment that you might have around
      for a human or a pet.  It should clear up before too long.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Enjoy your pets throughout the
      summer. It's so much fun to sit back and watch them go through
      their day.  How lucky we are to have them in our care and teach
      us how to slow down.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A week ago, I wrote this column
      and when I looked back at last summer's newsletter, it was almost
      exactly the same.  Of course the 'weather report' comes first,
      complaining about how cold the winter was and how it lasted until
      June.  The only thing different was the fact that hailstones
      were bouncing off of the tortoises shells on this June 1.  It
      is all over now and our warm days have returned altho the ocean
      breezes at night can make things darned chilly.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's amazing to see everyone
      come to life as soon as the temperature reaches 70 degrees. 
      The higher it gets, the more active they become, every turtle,
      tortoise and box turtle responds to heat.   But none as badly
      as those Greeks, Just Jim Jr. and Just Jim the Jerk and assorted
      Russian male tortoises who began running amok with their mouths
      wide open preparing to bite anything in their path.  I've never
      seen a group this angry.  I was forced to get busy and build
      them a prison.  It has worked out beautifully altho once in awhile,
      one or two escape.  I know when they are out  because I can hear
      the shells banging and banging outside.  I can never go anywhere
      for very long!  I don't know what I'll find when I come home
      and I never want to see anything terrible.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In my haste, and lacking any
      other space, I built the prison where I had planned to put in
      a mud and musk habitat.  It was where the grapefruit tree was.
       They are currently in a child's wading pool which they seem
      to like very much, however, if they want to breed, there is nowhere
      for them to lay their eggs.  So I'm considering re-doing the
      original area I had built for them.  They had to leave when the
      Reeves turtles staked their claim to that little pond and moved
      right in, pushing everyone else out.  <BR>
      Our club Facebook page has proved to be a lot of fun and very
      educational.  I imagine some people might find it annoying to
      have all of the Facebook comments showing up in their email boxes.
       It was a Facebook 'upgrade' but I think you can disable that
      if you want to.  Sometimes the conversations get very lively.
       I do like the new format because I don't have to click on and
      off of Facebook all day and night to find out if anyone has anything
      they need help with or new information to share.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Which reminds me to tell you
      not to feed goldfish to your turtles.  There is an enzyme (thiaminase)
      in goldfish that can cause neurological problems.  The enzyme
      is present in most saltwater fish.  It's the same enzyme which
      is found in smelt so don't feed those either.  What is safe?
       Minnows, mosquito fish, rosy barbs.  Better to be safe than
      sorry.  I remember buying smelt for the turtles a very long time
      ago but they smelled so bad that I had to stop and did switch
      to minnows which I got at the local bait shop.  My thought is
      that you never want to feed your pets anything that will draw
      in the predators at night.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks to Nancy Ghoshal for going
      to the Free Fishing Day to help with the accidentally caught
      turtles and to Elaine Martinez for going to Miller Park for their
      event and to Michael Rajkumar for bringing displays to the animal
      event up in his neck of the woods.  You guys are wonderful!

      on October 22 all afternoon at the Belle Cooledge Library.  We'll
      be doing free pre-hibernation checkups and answering all of your
      questions and there will also be a pot luck, so bring your favorite
      dish to share.</FONT></I>
