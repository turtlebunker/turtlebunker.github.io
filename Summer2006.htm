      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on Saturday, July 15th at 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library (South Land Park Dr. &amp; Fruitridge Rd) We&#146;ll
      be talking about the upcoming TURTLERAMA on August 19th. There
      was a complaint last year. Someone said there were too many dead
      turtles on display. I guess she was referring to the Horror Board.
      Since there was only one complaint, we won&#146;t change a thing.
      How else can turtle keepers protect their pets from the ravages
      of raccoons, possums, rats, dogs, lawn mowers, plastic bags,
      rocks small enough to swallow and paint on the shell? How would
      they know that swimming pools are dangerous or what a child can
      do to a tortoise and in some cases, even a veterinarian can inflict
      great harm? Come to think of it, perhaps we should ADD to the
      displays!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We&#146;ll also discuss what
      is going on in your yard in July. I do hope all is well and the
      winter did not take its toll on your turtles and tortoises. This
      is the very best time of the year because it is warm and dry,
      no rain or cold is expected for several months and the turtles
      and tortoises can live day to day without our interference. By
      the time the Turtlerama comes around, the sun is lower in the
      sky and things have already changed. The shadows are much longer,
      the days may be hot, but the nights are longer and cooler. So
      cherish May, June and July!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our 25th Anniversary meeting
      was crowded and wonderful. I brought out Newsletter #1 and Newsletter
      #100 and showed how not much had changed over the years. Not
      even the Turtlerama flyer! I do think the club maintains its
      popularity for that reason. Nobody really likes change. We like
      familiarity. There will never be a slick glossy expensive newsletter
      with vague information in it. You can find information on all
      species on the Internet. Our newsletter will always be about
      our own turtles and tortoises and how we manage them. As Father
      Dimitri pointed out at the meeting, we are a &#145;club&#146;
      and not a &#145;society&#146;. It&#146;s about OUR turtles in
      our homes and back yards. We also do all we can to protect the
      wild turtles and certainly stay on top of the continuing nightmare
      of turtles being sold for soup.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the time of our meeting on
      April 22, the weather had started to warm up after an extended
      wet and cold winter. I opened the door to the greenhouse and
      watched with mixed emotions as Tarzan Jr., Tilly, Fernando and
      Blondie, all leopard tortoises, eagerly climbed out without looking
      back. They were ready for summer fun! Chester, the Elongata,
      quickly followed as well as several other tortoises who had been
      in the Greenhouse for various reasons. It didn&#146;t take long
      before ACT 1 began. The tortoises have been living peacefully
      in the greenhouse since last October. There was no fighting even
      tho they were very close to one another on their heat mat.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here&#146;s what began to happen.
      Blondie, the large female with a mind of her own, goes into her
      favorite doghouse, ignoring everyone. Next is Tarzan Jr., her
      mate who is not quite as large. Enter Tilly who is a male leopard
      tortoise. He is on the small side. He&#146;s been here at least
      15 years and it took 3 years before he would ever peek out at
      the world. He&#146;s a lot different now. He feels compelled
      to find Tarzan Jr and torment him by getting behind him, hooking
      his gular under Jr&#146;s rear end and shoving him across the
      yard. Tarzan allows himself to be bullied even though he is much
      larger than Tilly. He will never push back. Very often, Chester
      will be watching and waiting and when he sees the activity begin,
      he will come running out (yes, running) and come up behind Tilly
      and start pushing from behind - so now there are three of them
      involved as Blondie grazes contentedly nearby while the boys
      make fools of themselves.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">ACT 2 - Tilly is placed into
      the Greenhouse to cool his heels. Peace is restored. But not
      for long. Enter Beamer. Beamer is a Russian tortoise who was
      turned over to The Bunker because of his naughty behavior. He
      was not very kind to the previous owner&#146;s female Russian.
      He does not get along with any of the Bunker residents. He spends
      the day running across the yard WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN, chasing
      anything that moves and is very eager to bite and ram them repeatedly.
      Due to this behavior, he takes turns in the Greenhouse with Tilly.
      Solitary Confinement is the only answer for their own health
      as well as the others. (And my sanity)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Same old story: WAY too many
      sliders have come in for adoption. Marilyn Flynn picks up most
      of the homeless from the Bradshaw SPCA while mine come in from
      everyone who can find me and also the Front Street shelter. Marilyn
      and I are asking for help. I have personally saturated the ponds
      of many people and need new homes with outdoor ponds where the
      sliders can live their lives in peace. So, if you have room for
      one or two more, some are large, we would really appreciate it.
      At this time, I have about 50 sliders and I only have room for
      10. HELP!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Please remember to look to the
      NORTHEAST if any of your turtles or tortoises escape. This is
      the way they normally will run. I think morning is the best time
      to look because that&#146;s when they would be on the move. Often,
      the pet has not left the yard but is hiding very well somewhere,
      even up on its side in a small crevice. They are masters at hiding
      themselves. I&#146;ve had a Reeves running crazily around the
      yard, escaping from her own enclosure over and over again. Today
      I put her into a small hard plastic pool with some red eared
      sliders that are up for adoption and now she is contentedly sunning
      herself on one of their basking rocks. I can&#146;t figure this
      out at all. Each and every one is unique and wonderful. Don&#146;t
      you agree?</FONT>
