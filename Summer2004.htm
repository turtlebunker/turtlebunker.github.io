       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> Our Summer meeting will be held on
      <B>Saturday, July 17th </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library from
      1:30 until 4 pm. The library is located on the corner of South
      Land Park Drive and Fruitridge Road close to I-5. There are no
      guest speakers lined up so I am appealing to all of you to give
      a 10 minute talk about your favorite turtle or tortoise. If nobody
      is interested in 10 minutes of fame, then we&#146;ll talk about
      summer problems, triumphs and tragedies, egg laying and perhaps
      show a video. No matter what, our meetings are always interesting
      and a lot of fun. You can count on that. Please be on the lookout
      for people who might be interested in being a future guest speaker.
      It could be your vet! If they require a fee, that can be arranged.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Regarding our April meeting,
      at the last minute, Darlene and Cheryl could not make it over
      the hill from Reno to be our speakers. I called Father Dimitri
      for advice on what to discuss in their place and he offered to
      step forward and do a desert tortoise presentation. Everyone
      in the room, whether or not they were interested in desert tortoises,
      was captivated by Dimitri&#146;s most down to earth and highly
      educational and often humorous talk about these fragile creatures.
      A renewed respect towards desert tortoises was gained through
      Dimitri&#146;s talk and we thank him VERY much. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The raffle has become the most
      fun part of our meetings and thanks to all who have donated wonderful
      items and also thanks to those buying so many tickets in order
      to win a prize. Don&#146;t blame me if your numbers are not picked.
      If you look towards the front of the room, I am not picking the
      numbers. We leave that to the children. I&#146;m only reading
      them out loud. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The TURTLERAMA will be held
      on AUGUST 21 at the Belle Cooledge Library. PLEASE sign up at
      the meeting or call or email me and let me know if you can exhibit
      or donate your time to help out that day. Angie Tamantini donates
      the wonderful array of plants which she cultivates all year for
      our Turtlerama. Thanks Angie. You make life beautiful for all
      of us. <B>SEE YOU AT THE MEETING!!</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Use your mister on these hot
      dry days. Clean up leftover food before dark to discourage predators
      including rats. Check frequently for upsidedowners. I have no
      idea why box turtles, in particular, often prefer to stay upside
      down to die in the sun when they can easily flip themselves right
      side up. Sick turtle? Before rushing to a vet, keep in mind that
      turtles and tortoises don&#146;t show their illnesses until it&#146;s
      too late to do anything and then the treatment often kills them.
      What to do? PREVENTION is the key. Cleanliness, proper food and
      a stress-free environment closely mimicking its natural habitat,
      if possible, are very important. QUARANTINE all new turtles for
      at least 6 months. I have a feeling that the &quot;Petco&quot;
      Russian tortoises are spreading deadly diseases. Be very careful
      no matter how cute they are. Don&#146;t mix them with your long-term
      pets.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">April 29th. It was warm and
      sunny. About 9 am the phone rang. It was Animal Control asking
      if I could please hold a tortoise for them since they have no
      ability to house them even temporarily. The tortoise had been
      picked up the night before and was in a box. Within an hour,
      the tortoise was in my yard. It was a beautiful African Sulcata
      approximately 2 years old and about 9 inches around and obviously
      very well cared for. I knew someone would soon be missing their
      pet. Sure enough, about noon, a frantic call came. The very relieved
      owner was on the other end explaining that her 2 year old took
      the tortoise &#145;out front&#146; and then left him there. She
      said she would pick up the tortoise when her older daughter got
      out of school.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Around 4 pm, she arrived with
      her 16 year old daughter. I took them to the back yard and she
      was so excited and happy to see &quot;Sherman&quot; again. She
      swooped him up calling his name and began kissing his face and
      head over and over again and I was getting a little nervous over
      this activity waiting for her to be seriously bitten. She was
      clutching the tortoise to her chest as she continued to kiss
      and rock him. It was not long before the tortoise let her know
      how he felt about all of the affection. &quot;HE LOVES TO BE
      KISSED&quot; were her last words before the waterfall of excrement
      squirted onto her chest and then splashed all over the rest of
      her clothing and shoes. Her scream could be heard for blocks.
      She was a stinky mess and when she left the yard, after I tried
      hosing her off, she had taken off her shirt and wrapped it around
      Sherman and walked to her car in her underwear. The moral of
      this story is - please do not kiss your tortoise and if you can&#146;t
      help yourself, then don&#146;t do it in my yard!! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Bunker is a very busy place
      right now. There have been plenty of red eared sliders turned
      in for adoption and since I put in the new pond for the ones
      who are staying here, there&#146;s no place for the new ones
      except the kiddie pools which I have to dump out twice a day
      and refill. If anyone wants to help, please DO. It&#146;s an
      ongoing problem. TURTLE ALERT -If you have a pond with water
      turtles in it and box turtles go in for a swim, be very watchful
      because sometimes the water turtles become carnivores for no
      apparent reason. Prevention is the key. Try to keep the box turtles
      in a separate area away from the pond. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Last October, during a windstorm,
      a pet tortoise of 17 years escaped when the fence blew over.
      The owner was not aware of the escape and assumed the tortoise
      was in hibernation at that time as he usually is. The tortoise
      was found shortly after by a passerby and turned over to the
      Humane Society. He was then placed into a foster home with two
      female desert tortoises. In late May, the owner realized his
      tortoise had not come out of hibernation and was quite worried.
      Upon close inspection, he realized that the tortoise must have
      escaped in October. He traced the tortoise to the new owner and
      now we have a situation unfolding. Should Boron be returned to
      his original owner or should he be allowed to stay in his new
      home where he is very comfortable and content and safe. Just
      Jim thinks he should be allowed to stay with the new owner. What
      do you think? The owner had registered Boron with the Fish and
      Game but the tag had worn off. If your desert tortoises tag has
      worn off, please apply for a new one by sending a self-addressed-stamped
      envelope to Ginger Wilfong, PO Box 2005, Castro Valley, CA 94546-0005.
      DO NOT MAIL TO THE FISH AND GAME.</FONT>
