      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
      Our Fall meeting will be held on <B>Saturday, October 20th</B>
      at the Belle Cooledge Library from 1:30 until 4. It is our pre-hibernation
      meeting, so feel free to bring your turtle or tortoise for a
      checkup. All I ask is that you keep your pet in a box and not
      hand it around the room because this activity could cause stress
      and illness. If your pet is already asleep, please do not awaken
      it, ok?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Several of our club members have
      expressed an interest in giving a little presentation including
      Joy Cornette regarding UV heat bulbs. Sally from Grass Valley
      plans on being there to discuss her desert tortoise problems
      and Rich Spekner would like to bring several exotic species for
      Show and Tell. Bring a dish for our Pot Luck and thanks ahead
      of time for all who do! The Club will supply the soft drinks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We are also in need of quality
      turtle and tortoise items for the raffle table and auction. If
      you have any items you no longer need or have doubles of, please
      consider this request.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The proceeds always go into the
      Sick Turtle Fund.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The<I> Turtlerama</I> was a huge
      success. We signed up 19 new families at that time, with more
      memberships coming in often from people who took the application
      home with them. The show was less crowded which made it much
      better for all involved. Those attending could enjoy the turtles
      and tortoises without being pushed aside and they could learn
      so much more from chatting with us. Shirley and Julie did a magnificent
      job at the sale table and we couldn&#146;t do it without you.
      Thanks to Sharon Jones, Joy Cornette, Sharon Chancellor, Craig,
      Kim, Suzanne, Darlene, Steve, Joe Torres and Joe and Sara, the
      Sadler family and to Jennifer for frying up her delicious home-made
      egg rolls for us. They were the best we ever had. (My apology
      to anyone I may have missed) Thank you all so much for making
      Turtlerama 2001 an unforgettable event.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The summer went by too quickly
      as it always does. Other people, without turtles and tortoises,
      do not notice the weather changes as much as we do because they
      have no animals dependent upon the weather for their survival
      in their back yards.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When we had the surprise thundershower
      the other night, I knew you were all outside, as I was, being
      lit up by the lightening, hunting for our creatures while holding
      our flashlights, to make sure they were in their shelters and
      out of the rain.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your turtle or tortoise was
      sick during the summer, it is better not to let it hibernate.
      When they go to sleep, their defenses are down and any illness
      that might be left will become fully active again while the tortoise
      sleeps and he will either die during hibernation or wake up very
      ill. If you hear your desert tortoise kicking up a fuss in his
      hibernation box, be sure to check him out because this is a sign
      that something might be wrong. Offer some water, check for swollen
      eyes or a runny nose and if all seems ok, then put him back in
      his box and cover him up. Sometimes we have a warm spell and
      that causes them to awaken for awhile which is of no concern.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Box and water turtles do best
      if left outdoors to hibernate naturally. If kept in the garage,
      they will dehydrate because of the lack of humidity. It is impossible
      to imitate Mother Nature in a garage. The reason we keep desert
      tortoises in the garage or a cool closet is because they cannot
      get wet but box and water turtles need to be wet. That&#146;s
      the difference.<BR>

      AT THE BUNKER</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Things were slow. The summer
      was cooler than normal and not many eggs were being laid. Even
      the biting, fighting, chasing and mating rituals lessened. Then
      the sick turtles began arriving at my door; box and water turtles
      with swollen eyes and runny noses due to the weather changes.
      With a lot of TLC and a little medication, all of them went home
      healthy and eating again. Quiet returned, but not for long.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A large desert tortoise arrived.
      &#147;She&#148; had been picked up by the right rear leg by the
      family dog and swung around violently before the owner could
      rescue &#147;her&#148;. The leg seemed to be sprained and &#147;she&#148;
      could not walk on it and was dragging it behind &#147;her&#148;.
      I gently pushed the leg into the area where it belonged and then
      duct taped it so &#147;she&#148; couldn&#146;t use it. Unfortunately,
      the duct tape wouldn&#146;t stay on very long. I put the tortoise
      into the greenhouse so that walking would be minimal. Soon after,
      the weather became very warm so I took the tortoise out of the
      greenhouse, which had gotten too hot. It was immediately evident
      that this was no lady!! Within minutes, the head was bobbing
      furiously up and down and my leopard tortoises, who were quietly
      eating, were suddenly being pushed around and bitten by the intruder.
      Obviously the tortoise was a male and a very aggressive one at
      that. The naughty Greek tortoises immediately fell in love with
      this big guy and began mounting him and making their little squeaky
      toy sounds as he was biting everyone else. It was back to the
      greenhouse at once!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My main concern was this guys
      leg. I had to find a way to immobilize it. Without Dr. Frye to
      call, we are all more or less on our own. I tossed and turned
      all night and suddenly figured it out. PANTYHOSE! In the morning,
      I opened my dresser drawer and took out a fresh pair of pantyhose
      and cut off the legs. Out to the greenhouse I went and looked
      the tortoise in the eye. He didn&#146;t know what to expect.
      I tied the pantyhose leg tightly around his right rear leg bringing
      it up around near the front left leg, sort of like wrapping a
      gift and tied it into a bow on the top of his shell. It is working
      like a charm and he can walk without further injuring the leg.
      He has not missed a meal, which means he is not traumatized at
      all.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I&#146;ve had to watch carefully
      because he is a strong tortoise and manages to undo the wrapping
      from time to time as he walks about. After 4 weeks went by, I
      unwrapped him and am happy to report that the leg is 75% better
      and in a few more weeks, he&#146;ll be as good as new. I hope
      this article helps others who find themselves in this predicament.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our deepest sympathy to the victims
      and families who lost loved ones in the recent terrorist attack
      on our country. On the night of the attack, I saw my leopard
      tortoise, Miss America, walk out to the middle of the lawn, dig
      a hole and deposit 6 eggs. She showed no sign of being ready
      to lay eggs, no pacing and no loss of appetite. I don&#146;t
      know what it means but I will definitely name the babies after
      some of the victims of the senseless attack.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tortoises become lethargic during
      October, they start eating less and less and are trying to empty
      their system of any food still left inside. Occasionally the
      white slimy substance in the urine will take on a different color.
      If you have decided your tortoise is well up to hibernation,
      do not try to give it an extra &#147;force-feed&#148; for the
      winter, the tortoise&#146;s digestive system is already slowing
      down and any food not digested gets left in the bowel and will
      have a chance to rot.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some people advocate giving their
      tortoises lukewarm baths every other day for about three weeks
      so as to make sure all food has been passed through. Personally
      I feel it is unkind to subject the tortoise to a bath at this
      time of the year, especially since the temperature cannot be
      raised to dry the tortoise off properly. Should you put the tortoise
      in the warmth after the bath, the digestive system would start
      up again doing no good at all. If you can, let the process take
      its natural course, if you want to give a little help, pour some
      lukewarm water over the tail end occasionally. It has the same
      effect as a bath would have and does prevent the tortoise from
      getting a chill. <I>Advice given by Henny Fenwick in her book
      &#145;Taking Care of Pet Tortoises&#146;.</I></FONT>
