      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will
      be held on <B>May 2 </B>at the Robbie Waters Library, 7335 Gloria
      Drive, 95831 (It's on Havenside too!) The meeting will have to
      be held later in the afternoon due to the ongoing events at the
      library on Saturdays, so arrive around 4:30 and plan to stay
      at least 3 hours. Bring snacks if you like. We'll supply chips
      and sodas. Of course we will discuss coming out of hibernation
      even tho our pets came out very early again this year and some
      are already laying eggs so we can talk about all of this, of
      course, and anything else. Bring a pet for SHOW and TELL and
      please don't put your pet on the floor or any of the tables -
      in a nice cozy box is fine.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thank you<B> Melissa Kolb Aipia</B>
      for the nice presentation you gave on such short notice about
      various weeds, the good, the bad and the ugly, at the last meeting.
      We did learn a lot and I think it would be helpful if some of
      you brought the weeds from your gardens to discuss at the upcoming
      meeting since a few of you were not there and some of us were
      'distracted' at times.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This will be our first Spring
      meeting at the new library and I will have a clear view of the
      back of the room where the food is from where I will be standing
      up front. It will also be our 34th club anniversary and I will
      buy a tasty sheet cake for us ALL to enjoy. I will also bring
      a clean knife. It was 7 years ago when I took the two candles
      with the numbers 2 and 7 written on them to the back of the room
      in order to put them onto the cake and light them up, etc. And
      for those who do not know, during the meeting, someone in the
      back of the room OPENED the decorated sealed cake and found a
      knife somewhere and cut the cake and served it to whomever was
      in the back of the room while we were enjoying the meeting. After
      the meeting, I was shocked to see the open container on the table
      with TWO PIECES LEFT - and about 35 people waiting for me to
      cut the cake and serve it.....I stuck one candle in each piece
      and walked away. The mystery is - WHO DID IT?? Nobody admitted
      anything. WHO BROUGHT A BIG KNIFE TO THE MEETING??? Was it clean?
      Who Who Who Who opened the sealed box with the pretty anniversary
      cake inside? Who served the slices to the people in the back
      of the room leaving two small pieces for everyone else? Seven
      years have gone by since that day and the mystery continues.
      One day we will get a confession and until then, the cake and
      knife will be right by my side and I will be watching you............</FONT></P>

      check your yard for debris that has blown in or carried in on
      your shoes, etc. Bits of plastic are things tortoises end up
      eating or even get trapped in if the bag is not torn open . Dog
      fur and human hair can be troublesome. Small white rocks seem
      to be a favorite meal for tortoises; sharp objects (don't forget
      the open pin I impaled my own toe on two summers ago) string,
      washline, even Bermuda grass can kill because tortoises and turtles
      don't back up if they become tangled in anything. They just keep
      going forward and can lose their life or a limb or both; nails,
      staples, even weed whackers can hurt them so make sure the coast
      is clear when you or someone else is mowing or edging the lawn
      or cutting down the tall weeds and grass by hand or with the
      string trimmer. I worry about the big lemons on my tree in the
      turtle enclosure raining down on the helpless turtles below.
      There are so many dangers. BE ALERT!!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT THE BUNKER:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Arial"> Just like last winter, the weather warmed up considerably
      in January while blizzards and sub-freezing temperatures raged
      back East without letting up, I believe it is still quite cold
      there even though it is now April. Here's a rundown of some of
      our favorite characters At The Bunker. <U>Helen Keller</U>, the
      blind gulf coast box turtle, came out of hibernation in February
      and there has been no change in her condition but her weight
      is very good and she seems to have developed a way of knowing
      a banana is close by. Her head is always turned to the left so
      she spins in a circle trying to eat. When I can't stand seeing
      this anymore, I put her into an overturned container with a doorway
      cut out so she has to stay close to the food and that does work
      until she manages to come out. She does hide at night so she
      must have some perception of light and dark. <U>Just Jim Jr.</U>
      woke up on time and within minutes of emerging, ran to find <U>Tarzan</U>
      the leopard tortoise, in order to pick up where he left off-ramming
      and ramming him for no reason at all. And since he seemed even
      more relentless, he has been in the greenhouse to 'cool off'
      for awhile. And <U>Zappo the Wacko</U> (these are Greek tortoises,
      my friends) also has to be kept in there because of extremely
      bad behavior; coming up behind PEOPLE and ramming their shoes
      and biting the bottom hem of their pants. If you put a strawberry
      in front of his face, he will lunge at that too taking huge bites
      out of it. I don't know what to make of that either. Does he
      think he is biting a person or is he just plain hungry? He does
      try to mate with shoes.....people probably think I am making
      these stories up until they come over and experience all of these
      aborations for themselves. Sometimes my 'teaching yard' teaches
      odd and unusual activity.......</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm thinking of having a<U> 'box
      turtle roundup'</U> one of these days because I have an overload
      of box turtles and my yard is way too overcrowded with them and
      Bunker 'guests' making me work very hard all day, except when
      I enjoy your comments on Facebook, of course. And since we are
      not allowed to sell anything at the meetings, perhaps I can have
      a<U> 'turtle stuff garage sale'</U> at the same time. People
      have donated a lot of wonderful items and all proceeds will go
      to the club and the Sick Turtle Fund. Let me know if you think
      this is a good idea? It would be on a Saturday or Sunday at my
      house, and soon. I'm thinking of May 16 or 17? The small Sulcata
      named <U>Andy</U> did well over the winter and still has not
      grown at all. I think he has been here at least 5 years. He is
      very shy but does eat well. Are there midgets in the tortoise
      world? Let's ask Dr. Ken!! I won't mention the abundance of sliders....even
      though I send a lot to someone else with a large pond, Animal
      Control and others deliver them to me in person. Which reminds
      me, I have not heard a word about the McKinley Park Turtle Relocation
      project so maybe that is dead in the water, which is not the
      right term to use, I know.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Since there is a little room
      left here, I want you all to know how much I enjoy our Facebook
      page. Your comments and questions are terrific and it's a great
      learning and sharing adventure. Sometimes people get a little
      cranky and that's fine because we all have the same goal, to
      give our pets our best care so they can live long and healthy
      lives. Problems come up as the seasons come and go and you are
      all a great source of information. I just wanted to say THANK
      YOU ALL for being such nice people and sharing your knowledge
      with others....good luck with all of your eggs this season!!
      You keep us on the edge of our seats!! Will she? Won't She? When
      will she? Why didn't she? Did she when I wasn't looking? Is she
      EGGBOUND? When will they hatch??? SHOULD I DIG THEM UP????</FONT></I></P>
