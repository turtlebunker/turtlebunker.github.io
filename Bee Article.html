Fall in Sacramento has a sound all its own. It's a season of quiet,
in which the squawking of a flight of sandhill cranes overhead
can sound like an aerial invasion. Just a car passing by on the
street comes across as an alarming whoosh.</P>

<P>And out in the Greenhaven area, neighbors of Felice Rood hear
the bonging and banging in her back yard. Maybe they wonder if
someone is shoeing horses or perhaps doing body and fender work.</P>

<P>But it's nothing of the sort. The crashing and smashing is
just the sound of testosterone-mad male turtles hurtling themselves
at one another's shells at sloth-like speeds to establish dominance
in a sort of reptilian World Wrestling Federation show.</P>

<P>The clatter of the shells may be the only sounds turtles make,
but anyone who thinks turtles are just those sad little things
that waste away in aquariums -- or those immobile objects that
sun themselves on riverside logs -- should take a look at Rood's
place.</P>

<P>Rood has hundreds of them: male and female, turtles, tortoises,
box turtles, water turtles, 30-year-old tortoises the size of
a small washtub, newborn turtles the size of a large walnut. Some
were born there in the yard. Some are adopted. Some are just there
temporarily in the hospital or for baby-sitting.</P>

<P>&quot;Heavens! Don't ask me to count them. I never count them.
If we started counting, we'd be way over 100 and we'd still miss
some,&quot; Rood said the other day in the yard amid her charges.</P>

<P>Rood, a transplanted New Yorker with such a lilting voice and
twinkling eye she could find work in the movies playing the fairy
godmother, is president of the Sacramento Turtle and Tortoise
Club and the person officials call upon for care and feeding information
on the shelled creatures.</P>

<P>These days, Rood and her club are engaged in a battle to have
the state Department of Fish and Game ban the sale of live turtles
for food. Turtle soup and other dishes are popular worldwide:
Baltimore has its famous terrapin stew, and some meat markets
in the Sacramento area sell live turtles as food.</P>

<P>But Rood is waging the battle with a bit of humor.</P>

<P>She has formed an organization -- Brutally Inflicted Turtle
Executions Must End -- and has begun mailing official-looking
notices to markets where the shelled creatures are sold, claiming
they are laced with hormones that will destroy the virility of
any man who eats them.</P>

<P>&quot;It's all for the turtles. We think turtles make wonderful
pets, and we want to see them taken care of,&quot; Rood said of
her efforts.</P>

<P>The work mostly is funneled through the club, which has 1,000
members who meet quarterly and pay $2-a-year dues.</P>

<P>Her labor is an attempt, Rood said, &quot;to pay back for all
the turtles I flushed as a girl. My mother would buy them for
me. I'd feed them some fake product called ant eggs, they'd get
no sun, no fresh vegetables, and pretty soon they'd die.&quot;</P>

<P>When Rood was a teenager, a boyfriend's mom had one of the
dime-store turtles in a dish in her living room that had grown
up to be the size of a saucer.</P>

<P>&quot;After that, I knew it could be done and finally, after
we moved here to Sacramento in the 1970s, it started coming together.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know if I'm really doing it right, but they seem
healthy and active and they reproduce -- boy do they reproduce!&quot;</P>

<P>She has a pair of turtle-care videos she sells to benefit the
club. And now, Rood is the expert who people with turtle questions
call in Sacramento, said Terry Jenkins, supervisor of the Folsom
Zoo.</P>

<P>&quot;There are vets around who are experts in reptiles, but
there are all kinds of questions about care and feeding and habitat
and the like that don't involve medicine, and that's when you
call Felice,&quot; Jenkins said.</P>

<P>For Rood, there's no question that turtles are the ideal pet.
&quot;It's that warm feeling you get inside when you look into
that face,&quot; she said. &quot;I've thought and thought about
it. I believe it's because turtles have been around on the Earth
so long, and they're unchanged today from what they were in prehistoric
times.&quot;</P>

<P>As for all the clamor when the boys get rowdy, that's a sign
to Rood that she needs to move a turtle behind a fence or into
a pen.</P>

<P>&quot;You can't let them do that. They're serious. They'll
fight to the death if you don't break it up.&quot;</P>
