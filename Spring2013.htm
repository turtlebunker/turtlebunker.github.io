      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our<B> Spring meeting</B>
      will be held on Saturday, April 20th at the Belle Cooledge Library,
      5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822 from 1:30 until 4 (or as close
      as we can get!) It will be our <B>32nd Anniversary</B>. We will
      celebrate! I don't know of any turtle club this old and still
      gaining in popularity. We try to bring the best and latest information
      to one and all. Our Facebook page has brought even more members
      and friends aboard and I appreciate all of your good words and
      encouragement and fresh ideas. Our meetings have continued to
      be crowded, lively and fun.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am sure your turtles and tortoises
      are wide awake by the time you read this newsletter. Feel free
      to bring one or two to the meeting to show off. Please keep them
      in containers because if they are on the floor, you will be handed
      a mop to clean up the entire room. I'll be bringing one you will
      be very interested in seeing, in fact, I think I'll bring two.
      You won't know whether to laugh or cry. A little of both will
      be appropriate. They are leopards. One you know and one you don't.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Your pets will begin laying eggs
      soon. Are you prepared? Do you want to leave the eggs in the
      ground? Or do you want to incubate them artificially? Or do you
      you want babies at all??? You can always buy expensive incubators
      but homemade ones work just as well (altho there was a mishap
      here a few weeks ago). If you will come up to the front table
      at the meeting, you'll see several examples of homemade incubators.
      I know a lot of you hang out in the back of the room and you
      miss some good displays up front. Don't be shy. Oh wait a minute.
      You want to be closer to the food!! Remember, Munch and Mingle
      at 3!! But I will allow you to have a drink if you are thirsty.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By the way, the anniversary cake
      will be up front so nobody 'accidentally' opens the container,
      cuts it up and eats it ahead of time as happened 5 years ago.
      It works better this way. We all get a piece!! And I know where
      the knife came from. And I'll have something to stick the candles
      into.....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our plant 'sale' has been terrific
      at each meeting. The plants are 'free with any donation' and
      it has worked out nicely. And many thanks to all who donate the
      wonderful assortment of cacti and succulents, geraniums and everything
      in between. Special thanks to <B>Angie Tamantini</B> and her
      son Steve. Angie pots them up months ahead of time to get them
      going and Steve does the deliveries, always with a smile. <B>Ruby
      and Alan Nakano</B> are also huge contributors to the stash out
      front. They also deliver many snails to my doorstep which they
      collect during their morning walks. I couldn't do it all alone
      and appreciate everyone's help and 'dues plus'!! So when April
      20th rolls around, I hope to:<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Your desert tortoises may not
      be fully awake yet so don't panic if they are not eating. Give
      them a drink and set them outdoors and as the weather warms up,
      they will return to normal. Be sure to give them a drink and
      check their eyes, nostrils and open the mouth to note if there
      is a foul odor or anything suspicious. Also, patrol the yard
      and look for anything small and harmful they might possibly eat.
      I stepped on a long pin I had accidentally dropped on the lawn
      while doing some sewing. I'm glad I stepped on it. I'd rather
      have it stuck in my toe than in my tortoises neck or worse! Hair
      accumulates (human and pet) and plastic blows into the yard from
      elsewhere, speaking of which, tell your neighbors not to spray
      their trees with any insecticide since the residue blowing into
      your yard can be deadly to your pets, especially if it lands
      on your turtle pond. Long strings of bermuda grass can choke
      them to death since tortoises don't seem to have a reverse button.
      Patrol often to make sure nobody is upside down. They turn over
      accidentally by trying to climb on objects or during mating or
      fighting. Prevention Prevention Prevention. That's the key to
      having your pets for a very long time. Please contact the club
      if you have questions of ANY kind. No question is stupid or embarrassing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I thought the winter would never
      end. I hate trapping the leopard tortoises in the greenhouse
      for months but it is how I manage to keep them safe and healthy.
      <B>Chester</B>, the ancient Elongata, winters in there too and
      manages to behave himself very nicely. In fact, they all have
      settled into wintering in the 8X10 greenhouse and nobody tries
      to get out. My Stanfield heat mat has been working for 22 years.
      I believe I got my money's worth, don't you? It is on from October
      through March and I do use a thermostat with it as well but rarely
      have to turn it up high. Low works well. <B>Kane</B> also has
      mats.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am happy to feel the warmth
      at last, altho it was not a bad winter. There were nights when
      temperatures dipped into the 20's but lots of sunshiny days to
      keep everyone warm and happy. Out in the yard, all was quiet
      except for a few Russians and Greeks deciding not to hibernate
      but sit in the doorways of their houses in the daily sunshine.
      I notice this happening every winter for the last few years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I have to admit that it is so
      much easier for me when the tortoises are in the greenhouse,
      since the threat of raccoons is much less and everyone else is
      pretty well hidden from any predators. They do stay in or under
      their doghouses in the yard. My pond area is totally overgrown
      and you can barely see where the water is underneath all of the
      plants surrounding it. I don't plan on cutting anything back
      either but letting it have a very natural appearance. The turtles
      like it better that way too.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There have been a few turtles
      turned in but are probably not available for adoption unless
      you want to devote your everyday lives to them. <B>Otis</B>,
      (red eared slider) is my main concern. He was turned in to The
      Bunker after the owner found him upside down in the yard with
      all four limbs destroyed by a raccoon. So here he is, doing well,
      healing nicely and eating like a champion. But he can't walk
      or swim, so he is quite challenged and therefore, so am I, trying
      to figure out how to make him comfortable and enable him to swim
      somehow and most of all, protect him from predators as well as
      the other turtles who would cannibalize him. Right now he is
      living alone in a tub and I place him on and off his ramp periodically
      during the day being careful to not put him in full sun. He's
      got lots of personality and is not inclined to bite and seems
      unaware of his disability. So wish Otis well, everyone. Any ideas???</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's been an incubator malfunction
      and this is a first! Two clutches of Leopard tortoise eggs hatched
      without incident. When I checked the third batch of 12, I saw
      that two eggs had holes in them and I could see a baby inside.
      Ok, I closed the incubator to let Nature take its course. The
      next day, no change. By the third day I began to worry. Why wasn't
      there any further movement and why hadn't any other eggs shown
      signs of hatching? So I picked up the two eggs and was very sad
      to see that there was no movement inside. Dead. And as I am typing
      this, the rest are way overdue and I'm afraid that the entire
      clutch was lost. Why? Who knows? This was my 'other' incubator
      which I've used many times without any problems. The temperature
      was good as was the humidity. I guess it was just 'one of those
      things'. It's all part of turtle and tortoise keeping. I hope
      all of you have a terrific springtime with your pets. Take time
      to be outside enjoying them as often as possible. They are so
      very special as are all of you, my friends, for caring so much
      and doing your best for them.</FONT></P>
