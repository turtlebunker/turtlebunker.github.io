      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">   I did not schedule
      a Spring meeting because of the ongoing bad weather and the fact
      that the library is just not a friendly public place to meet
      for us any longer, altho we could meet at night but nobody wants
      to do that.  Our afternoon meetings by the gazebo BEHIND the
      Belle Cooledge Library have proven to be quite successful.  Especially
      when we can actually be under the gazebo!!  I'll let you know
      on Facebook when we will have the next meeting, etc. and if you
      are not on Facebook, just email me or call for a meeting update,
      ok?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Boy, we sure had to endure an
      extra long/cold/wet winter and pay sky high heating bills and
      it took Spring long enough to arrive.  I do hope that you did
      not have any losses during the winter months  and everyone made
      it safely through hibernation.  You all know the feeling when
      that cute little face makes its Spring appearance and you silently
      say &quot;whew&#133;you made it&quot;  It still amazes me how
      they can withstand such harsh weather and wake up on time and
      be healthy!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A few weeks ago, club member,
      Matthew Goosen, dropped by and I immediately put him to work
      starting my lawn mower which had been idle all winter and he
      offered to mow the lawn in the back yard for me which was great!
       His reward was finding a baby box turtle on the lawn and we
      do not understand how it avoided being run over or stepped on.
       We were in shock!  It is so much fun to find a treasure like
      that once in awhile.  Remember my words - BE ALERT!!  Watch your
      Step!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I write this newsletter, I
      am sitting outside and I'll tell you what I see on this first
      warmish day of Spring:  the 3-toed box turtles are searching
      for their girlfriends after their long winter sleep.  It seem
      tho, that they don't care which one is which and just chase any
      of them that move.  I've let the Greenhouse gang (those who do
      not hibernate) out into the yard and they are VERY happy to smell
      the fresh air of Springtime and can now continue on with their
      lives and enjoy munching on the grass and weeds.  The sliders
      are basking quietly with their limbs outstretched.  It is so
      nice to see them out of the water and they appear to be smiling&#133;&#133;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Greeks are always quite busy
      chasing one another, looking for the perfect mate, but unlike
      the Hermann's tortoises, the Greeks do stop to EAT.  I only have
      one or two Russian tortoises but I have not seen them yet.  All
      of the box turtles seem to be awake.  Jim and Suzi were the first
      Greeks to awaken and then 'the chase' began immediately.  Never
      a dull moment around here!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">50 feet of fencing has to be
      replaced as soon as possible so wish me luck with that.  Had
      the weather improved sooner, it would have been done already,
      but now I might have to wait until the tortoises go back into
      hibernation.    If they see an open area under the fence or anywhere,
      out they go!!  It's just worry worry worry all of the time. 
      I know most of you have the same problems.     If you are having
      any issues, feel free to contact me and I will put you in touch
      with the right person if I can't help you myself.  We're all
      in this game together, aren't we, and have to help one another
      when trouble erupts&#133;and share the GOOD STUFF as well!! 
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Let me know if you can help at
      the show  and feel free to donate plants to the event.  They
      are always a big hit.  (I take the leftovers home and yes, I
      do share with friends and visitors!!)</FONT></P>

      Can't wait to see you all on<B> June 8</B> at the <B>Turtlerama</B>
      and thanks a MILLION for your ongoing support.  I couldn't keep
      the club going for this long without all of your help and good
      humor.  But we still do NOT KNOW who cut up the cake and served
      it to the people in the back of the room at one of our meetings
      so long ago while the people up front were listening to the guest
      speaker.  Nobody ever confessed.  We want to know - who brought
      The Knife!!!</FONT>
