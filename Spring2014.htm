      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will
      be held on<B> April 26th from 1:30 until 4 pm at the Belle Cooledge
      Library</B> located at 5600 South Land Park Drive, Sacramento
      95822.   It will be our 33rd Club Anniversary - THERE WILL BE
      A CAKE - and it will be up front with me and not in the back
      of the room where someone could easily open the big festive container
      (again) obviously meant for a party, take the cake out and cut
      it up with a questionable knife and serve it to anyone in the
      back of the room&#133;it has been 6 years since the 'event' and
      nobody has ever admitted their crime!!  The mystery of the cake
      continues!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The meeting will focus on problems
      you may have regarding coming out of hibernation such as swollen
      eyes and runny noses;  lumps and bumps, wheezing; limping and
      other things you noticed early on.  Hopefully these have cleared
      up by now and if not, we'll help you.  I had a number of turtles
      wake up and then promptly die with no symptom that anything was
      wrong.  Have any of you had the same problem?  It's always a
      mystery and it makes us feel bad but what can we do?  It's all
      part of turtle/tortoise keeping.  We do our very best but sometimes
      the weather is to blame.  We did have many nights in the low
      20's and perhaps that was the cause?  I also had several small
      'floaters' in the pond who appeared to be very healthy when they
      went into hibernation.  Hibernation is cross your fingers time!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Anyway, it will be a totally
      fun and informative meeting; bring a pet for show and tell and
      if you'd like to give a little talk about your pet, or anything
      else chelonian related, we would love to hear about it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding the meeting room at
      the library, there's been a little change in our usual way of
      doing things due to the difficulty securing the room for our
      events, so I had to make a change in the schedule for this year.
       The TURTLERAMA will be held on JULY 19th and that is from 11-4
      and I'm going to have you sign up for this event at the April
      meeting and you'll have about ten weeks to prepare for it instead
      of the three or four weeks after a summer meeting which is totally
      exhausting.  Most of the children go back to school in the middle
      of August and the State Fair had to move their event from August
      to July because of this change a few years ago.  It works out
      better this way.  (Lois, I'll set up your display!!)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Summer Meeting will be held
      on August 16th and the new members will be able to enjoy themselves
      and meet everyone instead of waiting until the end of October.
       I had put this idea out on Facebook and most of the responses
      were favorable.  It seems nobody cares when we have these events
      as long as we have them!!  I hear you!!  THANK FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the April meetings, we always
      have various homemade and/or commercial incubators on display
      and I encourage you to examine them and take pictures in the
      event you have some early nesting going on.  Most of the home-made
      incubators work better than the expensive store bought ones!!
       There are plenty of photos of them on our FB page as well. 
      Don't do Facebook?  Let me know and I'll email you the photos.
       Meanwhile, take good care of yourselves and your pet, furry
      and shelled and I'll <B>SEE YOU AT THE MEETING!!</B></FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Go over your yard with a fine tooth
      comb.  Dangers are everywhere so start by cleaning  up all of
      the debris that blew in over the winter months.  I'm pretty careful
      and yet I stepped on a needle last summer.  Ouch.  Was I that
      careless?  I guess so!  I was glad the needle stuck in my big
      toe and not in one of my tortoises eyes.  I'm not going to tell
      you to crawl around on all fours looking for 'things' but just
      be aware that dangerous objects pop up, blow in or are carried
      in on the feet of visitors too.  I hate to say this but sometimes
      the friendliest dogs will become aggressive towards your turtles
      and/or tortoises so try never ever to leave them alone together.
       Children can harm them too.  And do everything you can to protect
      them from raccoons and other predators.  Feel free to make up
      your own list and let's read it out loud at the meeting.  Keep
      us posted on Facebook as well if you come up with additional
      warning.  The list is endless.  We haven't even touched the subject
      of poisonous plants!  Pick up a list at the meeting.</FONT></P>

      Spring came early this year, in January, pretty much around the
      time of our Winter meeting. February was quite warm as well and
      lots of our pets came out of hibernation.  It was rough not knowing
      what kind of weather was ahead, should we feed them, not feed
      them, give them water or not?  So everyone did their own thing.
       Little by little everyone woke up and things are back to normal
      for this time of the year.  Fat Betty made her appearance and
      it was good to see my old friend and one day I saw a mud ball
      walking arose the lawn.  It was Suzie who must have been buried
      deeply for the winter, I'm not sure how she managed to come back
      to the surface with that burden on her back.   Just Jim looked
      the same.  Maybe they were hibernating in the same place?  And
      Jim is still cheating on Suzie but I believe she has come to
      terms with it.  At least they spent the winter together - underground.
       I can't wait to let the leopard tortoises out of the greenhouse
      for the summer as soon as the overnight temperatures are warmer.
       I'm also looking forward to a good spring and summer with lots
      of eggs being laid and successfully hatching, How about you???</FONT></P>
