<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was
      6 a.m. Still dark in the bedroom on the morning of October 15,
      1998 as we slept. My sister and her husband were asleep in the
      other bedroom. They were visiting us for a week from New York.
      Because of this, we kept our cat in the bedroom with us so that
      he wouldn&#146;t disturb anyone. Prior to the company visit,
      I removed the turtle egg incubators from the guest bathroom and
      placed them by my side of the bed. I also took this opportunity
      to take out the 10 eggs that were not fertile before they exploded.
      I placed the rotten eggs in a tray on the desk in front of the
      window. I heard the cat jump onto the window sill. What goes
      up must come down. The cat jumped off of the window and landed
      in the dish of rotten eggs and things went flying as he slid
      off of the desk. When the stuff hit the floor my husband said,
      &#147;What was that?.&#148; I replied, &#147;You&#146;ll find
      out in a second&#148;......and before the words were out of my
      mouth, the odor of 100 dead bodies filled the room. Think of
      the worst thing you have ever smelled in your life and then multiply
      it by 1,000 and you&#146;ll have some idea of the stink - not
      to mention the horrible mess I had to clean up - still in my
      nightgown with one hand covering my nose and mouth. Needless
      to say, Bill got up very early that morning and it took several
      hours before the room was rid of that stench.....and no eggs
      were on the menu for several days after that.<BR>

      Humiliation<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;America's Funniest
      Home Videos&quot; should have been in my back yard on the morning
      of September 8th. I had turned the sprinklers on and after awhile
      noticed a nice bag of snails my neighbor had kindly collected
      for the turtles, hanging in its usual place on the back fence
      in the turtle enclosure right next to my prized 5 foot tall very
      spiny cactus.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I gingerly stepped into the enclosure
      not aware of two mistakes I was about to make. #1: The ground
      was soaking wet. #2: I was wearing my ill-fitting rubber thongs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I reached for the bag of snails,
      one of the turtles nipped at my toes and I jumped. The next thing
      I knew I was falling. Who me? Yes, FALLING, FALLING. My life
      was flashing before my eyes. How? Why? Why me?! NO NO NO - BANG
      - I hit the ground and to my horror the 5 foot cactus was heading
      towards my face! Instinctively my hand came up and the cactus
      then hit my hand and arm causing my hand to slam into my nose............silence............So
      here I lay. It had to happen sooner or later. Lying on my back
      in the pen in the dirt with the turtles and tortoises. I surveyed
      the damage. Left arm badly bruised, bleeding slightly and swelling
      swiftly because of the rock it had hit. Left shin, same damage.
      Nose bruised and painful. Right forearm and hand full of a thousand
      points of cactus!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Nobody saw me, thank goodness.
      I shakily got up and saw the final humiliation. The half of a
      delicious ripe honeydew melon I had served to the tortoises was
      now stuck to my butt!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I crept into the house. If my
      husband ever saw this he would surely tell me to get rid of the
      turtles. I calmly washed my wounds and applied ice to the swelling
      arm and walked around the house with a nice smile on my face
      and a towel draped casually over the arm as if I were drying
      the dishes. &quot;He'll never find out,&quot; I mused, hiding
      my bruises and trying not to limp.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Later on that day we had to go
      to the hardware store. Naturally I hid that arm as best I could
      but I could not go out with the towel on it. We finished our
      shopping and were checking out. I thought I had gotten away with
      it. My husband did not notice. And then it happened. The owner
      of the store said very loudly, &quot;Hey Felice, what happened
      to your arm? Did one of those turtles jump up and bite it?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">At The Bunker - Almost A Disaster<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker is what I
      call my back yard full of turtles and tortoises. I allow visitors
      including children to come to the yard to view the environment
      and learn about turtle and tortoise care. As usual the WORST
      things happen when innocent little children are present. Once,
      a dead turtle was spotted floating in the water and another time
      they were treated to the sight of a dead rat, on its back, legs
      sticking straight up. The cat must have brought it by during
      the night. This latest event, however, topped them all and could
      have had chilling consequences.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A group of 17 kindergarteners
      and about 7 parents and a teacher came to The Bunker on their
      field trip. The children were seated in a circle on the lawn
      and I was talking to them when suddenly one of the parents asked
      me if it was normal for one turtle to be eating the other one!!
      Everyone jumped up and what we saw was awful. A small box turtle
      was bobbing around in the water and I imagine that he went into
      the pool in order to clean his private parts. Another box turtle,
      one of the large Gulf Coast varieties, obviously mistook the
      private part for a WORM and decided to clamp his jaws on it and
      would not let go. Without a moment's hesitation, I scooped the
      two of them up in the palms of my hands and ran off to the side
      of the house, away from the children. Luckily, the Gulf Coast
      let go immediately and the smaller turtle withdrew his &quot;worm&quot;
      back inside, uninjured, thank goodness. I honestly do not know
      what I would have done if he hadn't let go.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Upon returning to the group,
      I thanked the person who spoke up about the trauma taking place.
      One thing is clear. Murphy's Law Plus One exists at The Bunker:
      Whatever can happen, will happen, but only when pre-schoolers
      or kindergarteners are here!!</FONT>
