      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our <B>Spring meeting</B>
      will be held on <B>Saturday, April 21st</B> from 1:30-4 at the
      <B>Belle Cooledge Library</B>, 5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822.
        Spring meetings are always a lot of fun since everyone is eager
      to get the ball rolling again, cleaning up the pens after the
      winter months, making sure the turtles and tortoises are in tip-top
      shape for the coming season.  Sometimes they are not, so please
      bring your questions to the meeting and we'll help you with whatever
      might be going on. Most often, the tortoises wake up only to
      go back to sleep for a few more weeks until the weather improves
      again.  It's happening right now as I type and it is raining
      out there.......</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Soon, if the weather is warm
      enough, your turtles may want to lay eggs earlier than usual
      and you should always be prepared.  I'm not a big fan of letting
      them incubate in the ground for many reasons:  the weather could
      be unkind;  someone could step on the nest;  turtles seem to
      unearth an existing nest in order to place their own eggs in
      it, killing the existing embryos.  (It is so sad to see this
      happen).  When the babies emerge, you may not know it and accidentally
      step on them or worse, mow them down.  Birds love them too. 
      It's so much better to incubate them artificially and we will
      show you how to do that elaborately or inexpensively.  Both ways
      work!!  And it's a lot of fun watching them hatch.  As I've said
      before, it's as exciting as giving birth yourself!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I will have some absolutely beautiful
      leopard tortoise babies for sale at the meeting.  Michael may
      also have a baby redfoot or two available for you to add to your
      collection.  We are thinking of having an auction as well.  If
      you have any turtle item worthy of being in an auction, please
      consider donating it to our auction.  I know a lot of you are
      hanging onto something someone gave you which you don't even
      like but are keeping it for sentimental reasons.  It is ok to
      donate it for a good cause.  It will go to someone who really
      loves it and will benefit the club.  Of course, raffle and sale
      table items are always needed and welcomed.  Thank you all so
      much for your contributions, past, present and future!!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This meeting marks our 31st anniversary.
       There will be cake!!  I'm in charge of it.  You know why!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Winter meeting  was well
      attended but not overly crowded and we had a very nice few hours
      of turtle talk followed by the raffle and lots of snacks (thanks
      to all who brought them) and the weather was great too.  It always
      seems to be sunny on the third Saturday in January!!</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Turtle or Tortoise not eating?  Often
      it's the weather.  They just don't have any appetite unless the
      weather is warm, so check the temperature.  The warmer it is,
      the more they will eat.  <BR>
      <B>Fill </B>those gaps in between your fence and the ground.
       If a turtle can see out, it will constantly try to get out and
      will often be successful.  They are quite good at digging no
      matter how hard the dirt is.  <BR>
      <B>Pay attention</B> to your gate.  I highly recommend installing
      a spring closure on it.  Sooner or later, someone will leave
      it open and the turtles and tortoises seem to wait for this opportunity
      to escape.  <BR>
      <B>Before</B> buying new plants, keep a poison plant list on
      hand so you don't buy anything that will kill your pet.  They
      usually know what is 'bad' in the wild, but in your yard, they
      might not be aware.<BR>
      <B>Have</B> enough shelters for your pets so they don't have
      to travel far to find shade.  <BR>
      <B>Never</B> leave your dogs alone with your tortoises, even
      if they have been together for a long time.<BR>
      <B>Patrol</B> the yard often after a windy day to make sure nothing
      harmful has blown in like plastic bags or branches from above.
       <BR>
      <B>Toys</B> should be picked up too since a tortoise or turtle
      could climb over it (they never go around anything, do they?)
      and tumble upside down.<BR>
      <B>Keep</B> those little white rocks picked up.  They are like
      candy to a tortoise for some reason.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I was typing this part of
      the newsletter, it became clear that the words were almost exactly
      the same as last year's Spring issue.  The winter weather was
      not much different and the Leopard tortoises in the Greenhouse
      didn't do anything out of the ordinary.  Well, there was a Russian
      male tortoise in there temporarily who kind of made a nuisance
      out of himself biting at the faces of the other tortoises who
      were trying to eat.  I had to find a different location for him
      even though the Leopards didn't seem annoyed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The box turtles outside seemed
      content to wait out the winter by either hibernating out of sight
      or standing in the doorways of their doghouses by day and disappearing
      at night.  The Greeks and Hermann's and Russians know what to
      do and 'disappear' until around Valentine's Day.  Since the cold
      rain has returned, they have gone into hiding again but will
      reappear on the next sunny day.  It's their pattern.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Right now, however, I am really
      thinking hard about what to do to prevent another raccoon from
      coming into the yard to do more damage.  Everyone reading this
      should be aware that any turtle or tortoise outdoors is in danger
      of being attacked.  Sometimes I feel so guilty about telling
      all of you to keep your pets outdoors.  They are healthier living
      outdoors but safer living indoors.  I am spinning with so many
      ideas and each day brings us closer to summer when the attacks
      are significantly higher.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm afraid to say anything further
      about my plans to get rid of the raccoon problem for fear of
      setting off another firestorm of comments.  This is what happened
      on our club Facebook page not so long ago.  Someone who calls
      himself the Skunk Whisperer somehow jumped into the mix after
      I asked if 'coyote urine' would keep the raccoon away.  Not knowing
      anything about our club or me, he made some uncalled for and
      insulting remarks further infuriating everyone.  </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Facebook has grown to
      just about 350 good people and we continue to learn a lot from
      one another.  Many people say terrible things about FB and while
      some of it may be true regarding 'personal' pages, it does not
      apply to our 'group'.  As far as I am concerned, it's the best
      thing we have going, being able to communicate 24/7.  It is something
      we only dreamed about a few years ago.  I really appreciate and
      love all of you.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The latest recipient of this
      famous award is the California Fish and Game Commission for not
      only continuing to allow the importation of thousands of turtles
      into California for food markets per year, but for also ignoring
      a detailed Tortoise Trust report showing that 100% of  these
      animals are taken from the wild, and are not &quot;products of
      aquaculture&quot; as previously claimed. ALL turtles coming into
      California ARE wild caught...and are being treated as if aquaculture
      products. The law states that aquaculture products be killed
      prior to purchase...so the inhumane slaughter of WILD animals
      being &quot;called&quot; aquaculture products continues...</FONT></P>

      pride, you certainly have earned it!</FONT></P>
