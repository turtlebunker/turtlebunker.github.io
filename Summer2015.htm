      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on Saturday,<B> July 11th</B> at the <B>Robbie Waters
      library, 7335 Gloria Drive</B> (also on Havenside). Plan to arrive
      around 4 pm and prepare to stay for several hours. The Summer
      meetings are always relaxed and fun; the weather is warm and
      our pets are eating instead of on strike, active instead of sluggish
      and a joy to observe every day. Feel free to bring your favorites
      for Show and Tell and remember, please do not let them walk on
      the floor. The pets are to be in boxes at all time. The floor
      must be kept germ free!!! (Toddlers are the next group to use
      the room and that is the reason for all of this anxiety! You
      wouldn't want your baby crawling around on a floor which a tortoise
      had previously made a mess on). We can admire your pet even if
      he or she is in a box. After the meeting, you are welcome to
      let it walk around outside of the library room. We will have
      plants to exchange which seems to be quite popular and feel free
      to join in. We can never have enough. I hope to have some really
      nice cactus potted up and ready to go.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can see from the flyer below
      that we have a really cool new place to hold our <B>TURTLERAMA!</B>
      It's in the parking lot in front of the new<B> INCREDIBLE PETS!!</B>
      392 Florin Road. Date is August 22 from 11-4. I took Corrine
      Mason into the store several weeks ago and upon coming out, I
      noticed the wide sidewalk which was shady and it was like a lightening
      bolt hit me - what a great venue for our show! I contacted the
      owner of Incredible Pets and she did some investigating and there
      are no restrictions or barriers. WE ARE GOOD TO GO FOR THE SHOW!!!
      I did purchase two canopies if anyone wants to borrow them. There's
      plenty of parking. ACE hardware is right next door and on the
      other side is ROUND TABLE PIZZA!!! Manley's Donut shop is in
      the shopping center as is Taco Bell; a Japanese restaurant (Edocco's
      I think?); and a small family restaurant. So the setting is perfect.
      Please bring your own table and chairs. Let me know if you need
      to borrow a table? And we can all get together and help one another.
      We CAN get water from the sink in Incredible Pets. Overall, I
      think it will be a wonderful experience for us all. And nobody
      will be screaming at us. Peace at last!!! We will have our sale
      table - there are no restrictions........we can talk more at
      the meeting and PLEASE sign up so I will know who will be exhibiting
      and/or helping out that day. If you can't make the meeting, then
      email me your plans. It will be a terrific day, you'll see!!<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SEE YOU ALL AT THE MEETING!!<BR>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once Again - SUMMER HINTS:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Water Water Water, even
      in the midst of our historic drought, make sure all of your pets
      (2 and 4 legged) have access to clean fresh water at all times
      and if they sit in one place all day, just plunk them in for
      awhile. It's 104 outside right now and I've been hosing down
      those who are quite inactive just to make sure they don't dehydrate.Keep
      an eye on the ground for little white rocks; bermuda grass which
      they get tangled in; fox tails which somehow get into their eyes,
      needles, pins, nails, screws, pet fur, bits of string and yarn,
      plastic bags, thread and even long hair. I know it is difficult
      to keep one step ahead of our pets but we have to in order to
      keep them safe. Watch that the water in the wading pools does
      not get too hot. Move to partial shade on really hot days. Set
      timers to remind you to check often.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker is more like a zoo
      right now. I've never had this many extra turtles and tortoises
      to care for before in the tortoise hotel. It's really hard to
      keep up when the weather is so hot and I have no way of keeping
      the vegetables fresh for longer than a day or two. I wish I had
      room for a vegetable garden. I did buy a 'raised garden bed'
      from Walmart on line and Corrine came by to help me set it up,
      however, I realized there really is no place to put it. So it
      is simply sitting in the middle of the lawn. The 3 huge bags
      of dirt to fill it with are on my cart on the side of the yard
      and as of now, there are some Greek tortoises and box turtles
      enjoying the square which is now the hotel annex!! And my baby
      tortoises have to stay in their cages awhile longer. That's life
      At The Bunker. <BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Two new baby sliders were just
      delivered as I was sitting here typing! Not sure where they were
      found but I don't ask questions. I just take in the homeless
      with a smile. At our Box Turtle Blowout a few weeks ago, during
      the sale, etc. I was presented with two young desert tortoises,
      both of whom had been bitten by the family dog. The daughter
      whom they were staying with while the owners were on vacation,
      did a good job of sanitizing the wounds and bandaging them up
      and I was very impressed at how well she did in spite of being
      in a huge panic. The biggest danger are flies getting into the
      wounds. So I kept the two inside of my screened patio room for
      several weeks and inspected the wounds after about 9 days. They
      still didn't look too good (or bad) so I applied the veterinary
      powder I like to use and the tortoises continued to eat and act
      normally and last week, they looked so well healed that I let
      them play outside. The owner will be taking them home soon and
      they won't be near the dog who did not like them at all and used
      them as chew toys. Always be cautious, my friends. It can happen
      in the blink of an eye, even if the tortoise and dog have been
      together for a long time. I've seen it many times. The worst
      injuries occur when when nobody is home to stop the attack. The
      Greek tortoise who lost a foot to a chihuahua and had a badly
      damaged plastron as well did heal and is now in a safer home
      where he will never be harmed again................</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The broken branch is still hanging
      off of the huge lemon tree but the edge of it is resting on the
      ground so I'm leaving it alone since there is no danger of it
      falling right now, but most important is the fact that there
      are about a dozen box turtle nests in the area and I certainly
      do not want a work crew in there with ladders stomping around
      and compacting the dirt so the hatchlings would have no way of
      emerging after the first rain. Thanks to all who want to help,
      but it's just not the right time and I will let you know when
      it is safe to bring your chain saws!! Stop yelling at me because
      I don't want you to help. I DO want help, but at the right time!!
      MOTHER KNOWS BEST!!!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">THANKS EVERYONE FOR HANGING
      IN THERE WITH ME! </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
      club keeps growing and growing. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT.
      (Oh, there was no incident to report from the last meeting, except
      for one I can't put into print........ Can anyone guess what
      it was and who did it????? ) Thanks for all of the yummy food
      you bring to the meetings!!! See you soon!!! Enjoy the Summer!!
      I LOVE IT. Hope this newsletter arrives in good shape!</FONT>
