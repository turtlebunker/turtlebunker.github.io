       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will be held
      on Saturday, July 20th from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of South Land Park Drive and Fruitridge
      Road.  Exit I-5 (north or south) and go EAST for a few blocks.
       No speaker is scheduled - but our meetings are always wonderful
      due to the enthusiasm you all bring to the room.  We'll discuss
      your problems and successes and go over hatchling care of all
      species and how you can care for a sick or injured pet.  Most
      illnesses are easily cured if caught early enough.  However,
      turtles and tortoises hide their sicknesses very well and by
      the time we notice something wrong, it is too late to help. 
      Often, antibiotics do more harm than good, destroying livers
      and kidneys and diagnosis are never absolute as many of you have
      found out.  We'll talk about it.  If you are having trouble opening
      a turtle or tortoise's mouth, I'll give a demo.  Once you know
      how, it's not so difficult, although you must be careful not
      to get bitten.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We'll need to prepare for the
      TURTLERAMA on August 17th.  Any ideas for changes and improvements
      will be greatly appreciated and I need lots of exhibitors and
      helpers.  PLEASE sign up or call me ASAP.   Everyone is looking
      forward to it.  Let's not let them down.  Please pick up your
      flyers at the meeting or I can send some to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Try to bring one of your pets
      to the meeting for &quot;Show and Tell&quot;.   We'd love to
      hear about it.  And last summer's meeting was so much fun, why
      don't you bring a snack that matches the first initial of your
      last name this time?  I'll bring the Ruffles.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We do need raffle items.  Turtle
      related, of course!  And thanks to those who have donated over
      and over again.  It certainly is appreciated!</FONT></P>

      BEWARE OF TOMATO CAGES!</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I found one of my tortoises tangled
      up in a tomato cage I had bought and left sitting on the ground.
       Apparently he had knocked it over and then walked into it and
      since tortoises never back up, he became completely entwined
      in the wire.  I found him while making one of my 'tours' of the<BR>
      back yard.  I saw the tomato cage moving by the air conditioner
      and knew that someone was in trouble.  It took quite awhile to
      untangle him without hurting him and he seemed relieved to be
      free of his prison and had a long drink of water and then joined
      the others at the feeding station.    I also<BR>
      found a small turtle with a marble sized orange stuck in its
      mouth.  The tub she is in is under my orange tree and the tiny
      oranges fall off and I guess she took a bite and then her mouth
      was stuck open with the orange in it. I had to carefully cut
      the orange into little pieces to get it out.  You can't<BR>
      be too careful and must stay one step ahead of these guys.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The tortoise with the broken
      leg went home a few days ago.  His leg was completely healed
      and his owner was happy to have him back.  I was assured that
      the dog is no longer living in their  yard.  I had pushed the
      leg into the body cavity and then tightly wrapped pantyhose around
      his shell,<BR>
      trapping his leg in one position and kept it like that all winter
      and when I unwrapped him, he was able to walk perfectly.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The snapper escaped from his
      Rubbermaid tub soon after our last meeting.  He had pushed the
      metal shelf, held down my many bricks, to one side and simply
      climbed out.  When I went to feed him, I noticed he was gone
      and I was glad I was not barefoot.  I stood quietly thinking
      of where I should look.  I thought of all of the conversations
      I've had with others.  NORTHEAST, of course!  The northeast section
      of the yard is the main turtle enclosure.  I walked over there,
      expecting the worst, and at first I didn't see anything - until
      I noticed the water turtles basking in the middle of the pond.
       How could they do that - unless - yep, the snapper was in the
      pond with the sliders and most of them simply took advantage
      of the situation and climbed onto his back to take their place
      in the sun.  He didn't hurt anyone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I know he was happy there, but
      it's a very small pond, only 8 inches deep and it was overloaded
      with turtles and he didn't belong there.  Making sure my husband
      was not around, I bailed the water out of the pond.  The snapper
      knew I was after him.  He pulled his head in and had his rear
      end elevated which made it easier for me to gently put my hands
      on the back of his shell and pull him out of the pond and place
      him into the overturned garbage pail I had ready nearby.  He's
      content back in his original living quarters...is anyone driving
      to Arkansas in the near future?  Club Member Liz has named him
      &quot;Tyson&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I found a baby slider in the
      yard a few weeks ago.  And this baby slider saved a tortoise's
      life!   I put the baby into a container in the kitchen and after
      a few minutes decided to go out and see if there were any more
      of them.  What I found was a tortoise HEAD DOWN in the pond!
        It must have<BR>
      just happened and I got him out immediately and have no idea
      of how he ever got into the enclosure in the first place, but
      if it weren't for the baby slider, I never would have been out
      there looking around.   WHEW is all I can say!   For some reason,
      I find myself outside at the right time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On June 4th, I had Master Tree
      come out to do something about the sink-holes in my back yard
      where the huge maple tree used to be.  The problem has been getting
      worse.   Since it was a hot day, removing the tortoises was quite
      a job since they all hang out in that area.    It didn't take
      long before the desert tortoises, leopard tortoises and the Greeks
      came back by walking around the back of the greenhouse in order
      to supervise the workers! I don't know how the workers did it,
      but they managed to see and rescue the tortoises as they suddenly
      appeared in front of the stump-munching machine. I can't say
      enough nice things about these people. I highly recommend<BR>
      Master Tree Care.  Call 448-5557 or 391-8733.  Your turtles and
      tortoises will not be in jeopardy in their hands and they'll
      do a great job.<BR>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">CURING DIETARY ADDICTION</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      By Andy Highfield as seen in the Tortoise and Turtle Feeding
      Manual.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In more than 20 years of advising
      people about tortoise and turtle diets, the Tortoise Trust has
      encountered some terrible examples of dietary mismanagement -
      usually with tragic consequences for the unfortunate animal concerned.
       Some of the worst diets we have ever encountered include:  The
      Red-eared slider fed only on ham and chocolate.  The Sulcata
      raised on bagels and cream cheese.  The Mediterranean tortoise
      given bread, milk and cheese.  The Red-foot tortoise offered
      only canned cat food.  The American box turtle fed on ice cream
      and apple pie.  The Marginated tortoise reared on peas, beans
      and dog food.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tortoises and turtles do not
      know what is good or bad, they tend to have very 'addictive'
      feeding behavior once introduced to a particular artificial diet.
       There is no excuse for offering items such as bread, milk, cheese,
      peas, beans, ice cream, or canned cat and dog food to herbivorous
      tortoises.<BR>
      Even omnivorous and carnivorous species require sound dietary
      management. Should you encounter an animal reared on diets as
      listed above, you should cease offering the offending constituents
      immediately and re-adjust the diet to meet conventional and appropriate
      standards.  Some animals will resist the change to a safe and
      nutritious diet.  Simply continue offering<BR>
      appropriate foods and on no account revert to these &quot;killer&quot;
      ingredients. Ensure adequate hydration, but otherwise leave them
      to feed when they become sufficiently hungry.  Most animals reared
      on the appalling diets described above are, in any event, obese
      and suffering from a fatty liver.  Some<BR>
      weight loss is usually beneficial.  Monitor their progress carefully,
      under qualified veterinary direction, if possible.  Sometimes
      drug therapy is required to deal with the consequences of excess
      saturated fat consumption so typical of these diets.  Eventually,
      if offered appropriate foods and<BR>
      maintained under the correct environmental conditions, the majority
      of animals will eventually revert to a healthy feeding pattern.</FONT>
