      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our next meeting will be held
      on Saturday, January 17th from 1 until 3 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land
      Park Drive, off of I-5. I call this our &#147;Slumberama&#148;
      because there&#146;s not much going on in January, however, our
      club members look forward to having a mid-winter meeting and
      getting together to discuss mutual problems and plans for the
      coming months. If it is raining or foggy, I will call off the
      meeting, so call first if in doubt.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I would like to ask you about
      your methods of hibernation. Many times, even though we think
      we are doing it right, someone else has a better idea. I know
      the winter months seem to go so much slower than the summer months.
      It is as if Spring will never arrive. Eventually it does and
      not every turtle or tortoise wakes up at the same time. Some
      don&#146;t wake up at all. It can be very frustrating. I&#146;d
      like to know if you wake up your tortoises to soak them during
      hibernation. Some do and some don&#146;t. I don&#146;t unless
      I hear a lot of movement in the hibernation box. Then I will
      check out the tortoise and offer water.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was a lot of
      fun and informative as well. We had three contest winners for
      the best dressed chelonian for Halloween. The winners were dressed
      as a witch with a broom, a pumpkin and the first prize went to
      Craig, whose Redfoot tortoise was dressed up as a bunny. Yes,
      I know it was silly, but in today&#146;s world, silliness is
      necessary!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On a sad note, Harold Carty passed
      away in November. His lifelong interest in turtles led him to
      become a successful turtle breeder and lecturer. He lived in
      Chowchilla, California, and did a wonderful job tending to his
      large number of adults and hatchlings. Harold and his wife Naoma
      came to many of our meetings and Turtleramas with a variety of
      healthy hatchlings for sale and they enjoyed talking to all of
      us and sharing experiences. Harold will be missed by all who
      had the pleasure of knowing him and our condolences go out to
      his family.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now is the time to make frequent rounds
      of your yard. Rain tends to turn the soil over and rocks and
      other undesirable objects suddenly appear on top of the soil.
      Get rid of as much as you can before the tortoises wake up again.
      How are your box turtles doing? Mine are not all asleep. Some
      are in their doghouses. Many are under the doghouses and no matter
      how often I get them out of there, the next day they are underneath
      again. On sunny days they come out to bask. Quite a few are in
      the pond with the water turtles hoping to get cold enough to
      sleep. If you see a box turtle sitting out all night &#150; you&#146;ll
      know it needs some attention. Do not rush it indoors because
      that would be too much of a shock. Put it into its shelter but
      check for swollen eyes and a runny nose first. Sometimes they
      come out to bask but then it gets cold and they simply don&#146;t
      go back to their shelter. If the turtle continues to sit out
      at night and you think it is sick, bring it into the garage for
      about 24 hours and then into a cool room before warming it up
      completely in your living area. The same is true of water turtles
      and hardy tortoises. Anytime our turtles do not seek cover at
      night, you can bet something is going wrong. Don&#146;t wait
      until it&#146;s almost gone, although I must say that very often,
      when you suspect something is wrong, it is usually too late to
      save the turtle. They hide their illnesses very well.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The new pond is working out very
      well. I pump the water out once a week in the spring, summer
      and fall. Right now, I am leaving it alone because I don&#146;t
      want to disturb the turtles who are hibernating and since nobody
      is eating, the water stays clean. It&#146;s the end of December
      and on sunny days, several water turtles are seen basking. Fat
      Betty and her boyfriends were awake until just a few days ago
      when the weather turned a little colder. I am hoping they stay
      asleep this time. We had a few frosty nights in November and
      they did go to sleep, but when the temperatures reached 50 degrees
      again, they decided it was time to wake up. For those not familiar
      with Fat Betty, she is a Russian tortoise. She&#146;s our resident
      meteorologist. Her hibernation activities forecast the weather.
      After observing her daily activities, I am predicting a short
      winter and if it doesn&#146;t come true, you know where to place
      the blame.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The indoor Bunker is extremely
      busy. Although I hatched no sliders this year, a gentleman gave
      me 17 eggs one day. He had no turtles, but a wandering turtle
      laid her eggs in the dirt by his driveway and, of course, ended
      up in my kitchen where 9 hatched three months later. Too young
      to be adopted, they are enjoying their first winter in a sunny
      bedroom, perched comfortably on their hyacinth leaves with their
      little arms and legs stretched out and look so sweet. They share
      the bedroom with a bunch of leopard tortoise hatchlings and a
      guest Sulcata baby named Squirt. Several box turtles came down
      with various illnesses before hibernation and they are recovering
      nicely. They will be indoors until spring. I have a female African
      Sideneck turtle up for adoption if anyone is interested in giving
      her a good home. Many larger sliders have come in for adoption,
      some came in while I could still acclimate them to the outdoors,
      but at this time, the new ones must stay indoors because it&#146;s
      too cold outside for previous indoor pets. I am running out of
      room and hoping for a VERY early spring! I hope Fat Betty is
      correct.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In a box on the kitchen floor
      are two male tortoises. A Russian and a Hermann&#146;s. They
      are in the kitchen because their health has to be closely monitored.
      Lately it seems that the Russian is feeling much better since
      he spends his days standing up behind the Hermann&#146;s tortoise
      and tries to mate with him. It came to my attention the other
      day when I began hearing the familiar squeaking sound coming
      from the box. I had dinner guests at the time and it was not
      easy keeping a straight face&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;</FONT></P>

      Predators have been a severe problem this winter &#150; BE ALERT
      &#150; look for signs of intruders. Possums and Raccoons mess
      up your ponds and enclosures because they are hungry and smell
      something interesting. They like fish, but certainly eat turtles
      too. Has anyone used a motion detector with any success? Have
      any of you used one of the units that emits a sound that repels
      wild creatures? Would that help? Let me know if you&#146;ve had
      good results.</FONT></P>
