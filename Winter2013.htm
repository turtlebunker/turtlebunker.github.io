      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Winter meeting will
      be held on<B> Saturday, January 25</B> from 1:30 until 4 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library,  5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822. 
      I always called this our 'Slumberama' because there's not much
      to talk about in mid-winter but you've all asked me to continue
      the winter meetings - so here we go again.  This is YOUR meeting.
       Bring one of your non-hibernating pets to the meeting for some
      good Show and Tell.  Be a show-off.  We'll all love hearing about
      your special turtle or tortoise; how long you have had it and
      its activities, habitat and appetite.    Also, why don't we have
      a bake-off!  Bring a turtle/tortoise shaped food item for everyone
      to admire and eat.  I know what I'm bringing but I'm not telling
      you what it is.  There will be a prize for the most creative
      and tasty reproduction of a turtle.   Come to the meeting and
      enjoy.<BR>
      *Melissa Kolb Aipia will be on hand to give a talk on first aid.....and/or
      'How to start succulents from seed'.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding our future meeting
      dates, well, when the librarian we liked retired,  mass confuzzzzion
      has prevailed and I have been unable to secure the rest of the
      dates but hopefully it will be done by the time this meeting
      is held.  I'm getting a little tired of going to their website
      several times a day;  going into the library and not getting
      answers, etc. etc. and being told that the person I need to see
      is 'on the phone'.......'in a meeting'.  Hey, this is a very
      popular and important club!!   We bring a lot of people into
      the library which they like to see and I hope we can continue
      having our meetings there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Club had a great year and
      this one will be even better.  The Facebook page continues to
      grow and be very informative and entertaining and sometimes aggravating.
       Everyone seems to be an expert, including me and often this
      brings on a lot of friction.  I'm certain that 'Lee' (short for
      'leeches' folks) whom I wrote about on Facebook came from the
      new Korean market in Rancho Cordova as well as another turtle,
      the same size, who was run over - no pet turtles are running
      through the streets of Sacramento at the end of December and
      I've never seen a turtle with leeches before and I've been rescuing
      since 1975!!  Something STINKS.  And it was disgusting! (Animal
      Control delivered them.)</FONT></P>

      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      A few short weeks after the meeting, you'll start to see your
      hibernating turtles and tortoises again.  Some species wake up
      sooner than others such as the Greeks, Hermann's and Russians.
       Others are slower to wake up such as the California Desert tortoises.
        I'm sure you have some that have been awake all winter outside.
       Well, you are not alone.  Most of our members are living in
      California, where it does not get as cold as it does in their
      turtle's natural habitats.  I can't imagine them being above
      the ground in Ohio or Oklahoma City where there are sub-freezing
      temperatures quite often.  They are deep down until spring. 
      Out here I call it 'half-hibernating' which, truthfully, is not
      that good for them but they seem to survive.  It's best never
      to force anyone INTO hibernation or force them OUT of hibernation.
       Mother Nature's rules apply here.  Our pets have their own built
      in time-clock.  Nobody really knows for sure what triggers all
      of this activity, it is simply in place.   Regarding the turtles
      and tortoises you kept indoors for one reason or another, when
      you can go outside wearing a light sweater - it will be the right
      time to begin putting them outdoors again, longer and longer
      over a two week period until they are acclimated and then let
      the fun of spring and summer begin again!  Enjoy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">So far, so good, the days are
      moving along.  I don't have too many patients in my amateur hospital
      and have kept 'most' of the unwanted sliders with their owners
      until springtime or until they can't stand it any longer and
      beg me to take them in.  These are turtles in fish tanks who
      can't go out until it is warmer because they will die of shock.
       Most of the people donating their pets don't realize that they
      can and should live outdoors all of the time!!  &quot;WHAT?&quot;
      they say!!  &quot;That's not what I read on the Internet&quot;.
        So some things never change and anyone doing rescues knows
      what I am talking about.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I currently have a very old Eastern
      Box turtle in my care, at least 70 years old.  At her home in
      Concord, CA, she quit eating some time ago and became a recluse,
      not moving much and had seemingly lost her will to live.  The
      owners somehow found me and drove her here for my evaluation
      and decided to leave her with me to see if I could get her to
      eat again.  (I'll bet they thought they would never see her alive
      again....)  Her name is Loekie (LowKey) and her shell is very
      dark and very smooth from age.   It was a daily struggle, giving
      her warm soaks, long soaks, short soaks, indoor soaks, outdoor
      soaks, soaking with others, putting her in with others who were
      good eaters, getting her to keep her eyes open became a daily
      chore.  I tried all kinds of foods, good food, bad food, terrible
      food, red food, yellow food, wiggly food, crawling food.  NOTHING!
       Feeding at night didn't work.  Playing music did not help. 
      Eventually, as summer went along, she took a bite of a strawberry.
       Then one day she bit at a piece of watermelon, a week later,
      half heartedly tried to bite a worm. Mostly she slept. And slept
      and slept.    </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The summer went by, her owners
      came to visit and were pleased with her appearance;  somehow
      she looked good, her weight had not gotten less, but she was
      so darned lethargic.  Summer turned into Fall, the days became
      shorter and cooler, and the nights became longer.  I decided
      to bring Loekie indoors for the winter because being outdoors
      in her condition would be the end of her.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It began slowly, very slowly.
       A transformation was taking place right in front of my eyes.
       She seemed to be 'coming to life'.  She began walking around
      and suddenly, she began looking for food!!  Huh? So I gave her
      a piece of banana.  She ate it immediately!  Knowing the picky
      eaters love hamburger meat, I gave her some ground round and
      once again, she ate the whole thing.  Of course it is not the
      best diet, but I will give her whatever she wants to eat and
      have expanded her diet to include other fruits but have not tried
      the worms yet. I will very soon.  She is living in 'the drawer'
      by a sunny window and I am very pleased with her activities and
      am wondering if perhaps she has her seasons mixed up?  What do
      you think?  Some memory loss, perhaps?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, the Bunker remains
      the nutty place it always was.  The only additional  load is
      the fact that I am typing approximately 125 letters a day mostly
      to our Facebook Friends.  I am happy to be able to help so many
      people all day every day.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Otis and Olivia, the limbless
      sliders, are outside in a kiddie pool not really hibernating,
      but doing ok.  I cover them well at night so they never will
      be harmed by raccoons again.  They are joined by Shelly who has
      the shape of the bowl she was raised in.  The Bunker is quiet
      now.  Turtles in terrible shape arrive via Animal Control.  I
      take them in with a smile because it would be useless to be any
      other way.  Thank you ALL for standing by me and cheering me
      on and sending Dues PLUS when you can.  You are all so terrific!!</FONT></P>
