      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will
      be held on Saturday, <B>April 28</B> in the park by the Gazebo
      next to the <B>Belle Cooledge Library, 5600 South Land Park Drive,
      95822<BR>
      from 2-5 pm</B>. Feel free to bring your pets and a folding chair
      in case there is nowhere to sit in the park. In case it is raining,
      we'll just have it the following Saturday if that is ok with
      everyone? I've run out of ideas since nobody wants to have any
      night meetings. Meeting outdoors is great because we can bring
      our pets and show them off and if anyone wants to give a little
      talk about their pet, that will be wonderful!! Looking forward
      to seeing many of you there. There won't be any cake to celebrate
      our <B>37th anniversary</B> but I will bring some sodas, ice
      and chips, etc.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I hope your winter months went
      by smoothly without any casualties and I'm sure some are still
      in hibernation as I am writing this newsletter. Most of the Bunker
      residents are awake now and it is good to see them again. I do
      hope all of yours woke up and are healthy and hungry and ready
      for a good long summer of enjoying their lives and us enjoying
      them!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You'll notice the flyer for our
      <B>2018 TURTLERAMA on June 2nd</B> this year. I am hoping the
      temperature will not soar to 104 or 106 in June as it has been
      doing in August. PLEASE let me know if you will be able to bring
      some of your pets to show off to the visitors to the event. Please
      email or phone me or let me know at the meeting if you can participate.
      We need displays and definitely need helpers for setting up and
      breaking down displays altho we don't have that many displays
      thanks to the library shutting us out. Tracey and Steve will
      be bringing their fully grown Sulcata, Ben, to the show because
      it is very important to show people in person how large these
      tortoises grow. You might want to bring photos of the environments
      in your own back yards to show people the correct way to house
      their pets. There will be plenty to talk about at our meeting
      on April 28. Your ideas will be greatly appreciated and put to
      good use.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I decided to delete what I had
      first written here because I am sure you are tired of hearing
      about rats and raccoons visiting The Bunker and doing a lot of
      damage. We'll talk about the fun stuff instead:<BR>
      There are plenty of visitors to the Bunker. They arrive quite
      often and enjoy seeing so many different turtles and tortoises.
      There are incredible amounts of emails coming in as you can imagine.
      Keeps me busy trying to answer everyone's questions as best I
      can. Remember, this is a hotel, hospital, hospice, orphanage
      all for turtles and tortoises. The visitors are amazed at the
      number of creatures living here and fairly peacefully too. I
      place the naughty aggressive ones into their own 'prison' area
      (sadly, some do manage to climb out and terrorize the others
      before I see or hear them.....and run out to put them back. If
      they continue this behavior, they go into the greenhouse which
      is pretty nice!)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The ones living in isolation
      are really not 'naughty', they are just doing their thing which
      is to mate as often as possible and as aggressively as possible
      I might add. Even if the females are willing, the males persist
      in shoving them, biting them and even sometimes dumping them
      upside down which is not very nice. Many of the females, however,
      seem to enjoy the chase and often stop running and turn around
      to make sure the male is still there and often encourage this
      behavior. I leave everyone alone unless they start biting and
      causing harm to one another. Box turtles are usually guilty of
      biting and not letting go. Sometimes the Gulf Coast box turtles
      may drown their mate.......Be Alert!<BR>
      The Chinese or Asian box turtles can do a lot of harm biting
      the back of the neck of the females so be aware of that. Check
      the females from time to time. You don't want any maggot infestations.
      They will often pull their heads in so you won't see the wounds.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Hermann's tortoises seem
      to be the most aggressive. They are relentless in their pursuit.
      They never seem to tire of the 'game'. And it can be very annoying
      to watch this behavior. But if you watch closely, the females
      do not seem to mind at all. The Greek tortoises are not quite
      so bad. The Russians try but they seem to prefer to fight with
      other males than do anything else. I don't see this behavior
      in the larger tortoises like the Leopards and Desert tortoises.
      (I don't have any Sulcatas so I can't report on them). But the
      larger species seem not to be so violent with the females and
      will often 'shove' them around but not dump them upside down,
      but sometimes accidents happen, and then someone will post a
      video playing soft 'friends' music as one tortoise tries to upright
      the other. Of course, most people don't realize that the male
      did this in the first place and is trying to fix things so he
      can continue this behavior. Those of us who 'know', are very
      amused by these videos and the public's response to them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Enjoy your pets and their lifestyle.
      You are all doing a wonderful job caring for them.</FONT></P>
