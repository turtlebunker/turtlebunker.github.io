       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">,  Our SUMMER meeting will be held on
      <B>Saturday, July 15th</B> at the Belle Cooledge Library. I have
      the meeting room from 5-10 pm  (nobody can have the 'public'
      meeting room before five unless it is a library event). We can
      do what we did for the last meeting in April.  We can meet in
      the park next to the library starting around 3 pm and talk and
      enjoy each other and our pets and then at 5,  those who want
      to attend the meeting can go into the library room and others
      can leave or stay awhile.  It's up to you and this is the best
      I can do.   We had a nice group gathering last time and I expect
      it will be even better this time.   Please place pets in containers
      inside of the library room.  We don't want to leave anything
      smelly &amp; icky on the floor..............</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I haven't heard much about the
      status of the McKinley Park Pond. The turtles were given to anyone
      who came to the door of the Front Street Animal Shelter.  The
      Land Park ponds have not ben re-filled because there is some
      sort of problem there but I did see on the news that the McKinley
      pond renovation was complete.  I think little by little people
      will be dropping off their turtles.....and it will become a safe
      haven for the turtles once again and a place of enjoyment for
      the children.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As you notice below, we will
      be having our TURTLERAMA in the parking lot again because just
      about everyone likes it there.   The only problem last year was
      the intense heat, I believe it was 104 with no breeze blowing
      at all which made it feel more like 110!.   Incredible Pets is
      open for us to cool off in.  Personally I can't complain about
      the heat because I spend each winter complaining about how cold
      I am.....it was a dreadfully chilly winter for Sacramento.  And
      a little too wet?????  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Steve and Tracy will be bringing
      Ben, their giant Sulcata, to the Turtlerama and his corral and
      hay and we'll have a small Sulcata there as well to show the
      public what to expect in the future if they buy a baby Sulcata.
       I'll have the sign up sheet for the show at the meeting and
      if you can't be there, PLEASE let me know if you are going to
      be displaying your turtles or tortoises or helping at the show.
        I would be happy to help at the Kids Korner.  It is shady on
      the sidewalk by the pet shop all day.  Please bring your own
      table and chairs......we'll make it work again.............THANKS
      SO MUCH.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's a busy place all year long.
       Due to all of the activity going on daily, I didn't have a chance
      to have the Box Turtle Blowout and I do have some for adoption/sale
      not to mention a huge assortment of 'things' you might need including
      various sized aquariums;  Two Tortoise Homes;  Huge wooden boxes
      for keeping tortoises /turtles indoors in during the winter months
      who are sick or you don't want them to hibernate, etc. and an
      assortment of lights and pumps and it is making the yard quite
      a mess so if you need any of these things, just let me know.
       The Bunker has turned into what looks like a Hoarders Paradise.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I've had many nests dug by the
      box turtles since coming out of hibernation and especially during
      the recent heat wave but oddly enough, there are no eggs in the
      holes which are all over the lawn.  No tortoises have laid eggs
      except for Suzie, the Greek, who laid 3 one afternoon.....but
      two weeks ago she dug an enormous nest and covered it up.  I
      couldn't wait to dig the eggs up.  I figured there must be about
      a dozen or more in the nest. I carefully dug, I dug some more............I
      dug until I hit the bottom of the nest.  Not one egg was laid.
      ???  Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?  It's a
      first for me.  As I said, the box turtles left empty holes in
      the ground but Suzie covered the whole thing up!   Maybe she'll
      do her job with the next full moon?  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One of our club members with
      a beautiful pond took 5 large red ears home about two weeks ago.
       I had more but she didn't want to overload her pond.......and
      the other night, here At The Bunker,  there was a raid, I'm assuming
      the rats are back after a blissful winter without them.  There
      are injuries and I'm very unhappy because they cannot be adopted
      out and cleaning out these ponds every day is a bit too much
      for anyone to deal with along with everything else, but I take
      a deep breath and simply do it because the turtles are worth
      the effort. And it is my fault.  I just WISH I had let them go
      somewhere and not kept them to be sitting ducks for those lousy
      predators who are so evil praying on innocent turtles who harm
      nothing.   How do you prevent predators?  We usualy don't suspect
      anything until it is too late. The Driveway Patrol is helpful
      but does not detect rats.  I guess they are too low to the ground?
       If you have a vegetable garden, that will draw them to your
      yard.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Everyone seems to be behaving
      this season (so far) and I think I solved the problem of the
      escape route the tortoises created in the back of the yard. 
      I put a bottom under the doghouse I had back there so the tortoises
      and box turtles now go into the dog house and don't begin madly
      digging and digging until they come out in my neighbors yard.
       It's an area which is invisible to humans.  Every day it is
      a struggle to keep them from escaping.  My neighbor recently
      found one of my  Russian tortoises in her compost pile and he
      obviously had been there for quite some time since he was the
      color of the compost!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty and the gang are all
      doing fine.  Everyone has been rather quiet probably due to the
      extremely hot weather we had.  In fact, everyone is quite lazy
      so far this year.  A 'new' Just Jim was turned in and he was
      so so BAD, assaulting everyone and then the fence blew down.
       He escaped immediately but was returned two days later by the
      nice family behind the house next door......and they have a swimming
      pool but luckily, it is fenced and the children saw him walking
      along the fence line and told Mom and Dad and they knew where
      he came from, so he had a safe return and now even he is being
      very nice to his Bunkermates.  I don't understand it but I'm
      not complaining either.  </FONT></P>
