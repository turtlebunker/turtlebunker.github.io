      our club members brought down his 13 box turtles for me to baby-sit
      for two weeks and I nearly fainted when I saw them. All had very
      long nails and overgrown beaks to the point where some looked
      like ducks. One resembled a platypus! Can you imagine cutting
      148 nails?? The beaks were too thick to trim and curiously enough,
      the bottom beaks thickened up to match the upper beaks/ Here
      is some advice from Henny Fenwick&#146;s book (She is our British
      connection) &#147;Taking Care of Your Pet Tortoise.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
      The nails of a tortoise are one of its greatest assets. There
      are five nails on the forefoot and four on the hindfoot, except
      in the case of the Horsfieldi tortoise which has four toes on
      every foot. The nails serve as tools in shredding the food, in
      digging and in assisting the tortoise in climbing rocky ground.
      In the wild they will wear down naturally but in captivity they
      can grow to an uncomfortable length. It is not a bad idea to
      provide some paving slabs in the tortoise enclosure to aid grinding
      down the nails.<BR>
<BR>
      When young, the nails will still be soft enough to be cut with
      nail clippers or scissors. Hold the leg up to the light and check
      the nail. It can be cut at the point where the nail becomes transparent.
      If the tortoise is older, the nails will be too tough to be tackled
      by nail clippers. I found wire clippers very successful. Be sure
      not to damage the cuticle as this can lead to sores. Torn nails
      and sores can be treated with a pevidine solution (Betadine works)
      or other antiseptic ointment. A vet can cut the nails for you
      and also treat ingrown toenails. Note: Some tortoises appear
      to have no nails at all, they have been worn away by too hard
      a surface. Just keep an eye out for infection.<BR>
<BR>
      Regarding &#147;Parrot Beaks&#148;, tortoises have no teeth but
      have horny ridges with which they chew quite successfully. Occasionally,
      the top jaw will overgrow or even chip, giving the tortoise a
      parrotlike appearance. This can be remedied by carefully cutting
      the rim with nail clippers and filing with a piece of emery paper.
      Give the tortoise some &#147;chewy&#148; food, cabbage (not too
      much), carrot and apple, to help prevent the condition, which
      may be due to incorrect feeding, a previous jaw injury or a birth
      defect..</FONT></P>

      Saturday morning, July 19th. I woke up, tidied up the bedroom
      and, as usual, peered into the turtle egg incubator in the next
      room before going downstairs to start the day. Hmm, another EXPLODED
      EGG!! It was no surprise. The Hermann's tortoise eggs exploded
      all of the time because they were not fertile and the odor is
      indescribable and once caused my husband to yell out, &quot;Honey,
      I think the cat died.&quot; But this egg was very clean. There
      was no smell. I shrugged my shoulders, my mind was blank. I threw
      away the broken shell and went downstairs to start the day.<BR>
<BR>
      Sunday morning, after the full moon, was bright and clear and
      breezy. I went in to check the incubator and I was so dismayed
      to see another broken egg - curiously - odorless. Hey, wait a
      minute. I froze. How could I be this stupid? Maybe, just maybe
      the eggs actually hatched??? My mood was changing rapidly from
      dismay to total elation. My heart was racing. It had been more
      than 6 years since any of the Hermann's eggs had hatched. I poked
      my finger around the other eggs, deep into the layer of green
      moss the eggs were sitting on and I felt something and then I
      felt something else!! BABIES! BABY HERMANN'S!!! What a thrill
      that was and are they ever cute.<BR>
<BR>
      I checked the calendar and noticed that the eggs were laid on
      May 24th and hatched 56 days later which is exactly on time.
      This proves that miracles do happen. Don't throw out any eggs
      that you assume are infertile! Mother Nature has many tricks
      up her sleeve.<BR>
<BR>
      And, as if this was not enough......on September 15th....a full
      moon night.....I noticed a hole in the ground in the rear of
      the yard where the tortoises all hang out since the huge maple
      tree was removed. It was nearly dark. I could hardly sleep wondering
      what could have hatched. I got up early and looked and looked
      and found nothing until......eeeeek...... I saw a tiny Hermann's
      tortoise sunning himself on a layer of tree fungus. Oh boy. I
      was in a tizzy. I dug down into the nest to see how many shells
      I could find and came up with a good handful. I kept searching
      throughout the day and found nothing. Around 4 PM, I saw a slight
      movement. This time I discovered a newly hatched red-eared slider.
      The plot thickened. What came out of that hole? The tortoise
      or the turtle? Both?? - Unlikely, but around here, anything is
      possible. Both hatchlings had no visible yolk sacs. Club member,
      Jan Peter, came by. In no time I had her on her hands and knees
      searching for hatchlings too. No luck. Oklahoma club member,
      Pam Keyes, emailed me and said to run my mister in that area
      and the babies would congregate there. Good theory. It did not
      work. I never found any more hatchlings but in all of these years,
      26 to be exact, I have NEVER had a Hermann's tortoise hatch outdoors.
<BR>
<BR>
      Note: Since writing the newsletter, I have discovered two more
      Hermann hatchlings outdoors. They are noticeably smaller than
      the ones incubated and hatched indoors and their color is also
      more sandy instead of bright black and cream. It will be interesting
      to see how they mature. I also have had several of my Leopard
      tortoise eggs hatch and they appear to be doing fine. It is as
      if the stork is hovering above my home this year.<BR>
<BR>
      Two more opossums came to visit. One was caught after the damage
      was done but the second was caught before he could kill. Both
      were released into a park by the river. Several people have told
      me not to release them but to drown them. I don't think I could
      do that. Ideas anyone? I'm getting ready to install an electric
      fence. I think it's the only sure way to keep them out. Be alert,
      everyone. Keep your eyes open and protect your pets from this
      unpleasant experience.</FONT>
