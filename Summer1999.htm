      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As of this writing at the beginning
      of June, the weather is cool and windy and the temperatures at
      night are in the 40's. It's a repeat of last year's weather and
      the Bunker residents are hoping the summer weather will begin
      soon. Egg laying has been delayed and appetites are down. Fighting,
      however, is at an all time high. The tortoises congregate by
      the kitchen door most of the day awaiting the arrival of food.
      They mill about, sniffing the ground, tasting anything that might
      be edible. I often find some of them upside down. I thought they
      were trying to climb the steps in order to get into the kitchen
      (as Clyde, the Elongata, so often does) and then tumbling upside
      down in the process. The other day, however, I happened to see
      what is really happening out there. Tillie, a smaller Leopard
      tortoise, started pushing all of the other tortoises around.
      He would put his head underneath their shells and push them until
      they flipped over. Luckily the porch is always in the shade.
      Since Leopards are notoriously shy and non-threatening, I can
      only assume he found out he has a girls name.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A male Russian has arrived at
      the Bunker and I had high hopes of him taking an interest in
      either Fat Betty or her daughter, but all he does is eat and
      sleep. The handsome male Hermann's tortoise who came in during
      the winter months and stayed in the greenhouse does not appear
      to be helping my breeding project at all. He spends his days
      chasing the Elongatas. He'll pause to inspect a female Hermann,
      and then continue on his merry way, unaware of the disappointment
      he is causing me and all of the people who would love to have
      a hatchling.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Other than having a water turtle
      jump out of the box inside my car, having snails crawling on
      my kitchen table and my husband taking the margarine tub out
      of the refrigerator and finding some redworms stuck to the lid.......things
      have been fairly normal. It is a joy to have everyone out of
      the greenhouse doing what they do best - enjoying the outdoor
      sunshine and munching on the fresh green grass. The tortoises
      look better and are enjoying their freedom and I hope we have
      extended warmth until Thanksgiving. Keep your fingers crossed.</FONT></P>

      by Ann Hirschfeld</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This past year I finally had
      some success breeding my pair of yellowfoot tortoises (Geochelone
      denticulata). My female had laid eggs in the spring of 1996 but
      they never hatched. Last spring she deposited three clutches
      of eggs approximately two months apart and each clutch produced
      at least one hatchling. I discovered during this period that
      yellowfoot eggs need to be incubated at 80 degrees F. with 80
      to 90% humidity. I learned the hard way even a few degrees higher
      can cause deformities and even death in the developing tortoises
      but that is material for another article altogether. With the
      last clutch of two eggs, I lowered the temperature while they
      were a month and a half into incubation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">About three weeks later I noticed
      one of the eggs had cracked laterally about halfway around. A
      few days later the second egg had done the same thing but not
      quite as bad. The egg with the biggest crack was oozing what
      appeared to be albumen (egg white) with blood vessels in it.
      Well, to say the least, I felt hopeless for the future of these
      eggs and to know they at one time were viable was very disheartening.
      I learned from a friend who had read in Vivarium magazine (Volume
      8 Number 5) how to repair a cracked egg by adhering it with cellophane
      and Vaseline. I figured it was worth a try on the egg which had
      not begun to leak. The oozing egg was left alone<BR>
      and with time the seeping liquid turned a disgusting reddish
      black (I should have warned you from the beginning this story
      would not be pretty!) For some reason I never threw this egg
      away. I thought about it a few times but as I said before, if
      it doesn't stink.....and it didn't so in the<BR>
      incubator it stayed. I basically had written these poor eggs
      off.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Two months went by and right
      about the time they were due to hatch, I looked into the incubator
      to see what was happening with them. The nasty, seeping egg had
      burst open on one end and I assumed it had exploded. When I picked
      it up, I peeled back the eggshell to have a peek (I just can't
      help myself) and came face to face with an alert baby yellowfoot
      (deja vu)!<BR>
      I nearly had a heart attack but got over it and then was just
      plain happy! This baby hatched normally and altho small it was
      a healthy tortoise. The only thing abnormal was that the yolk
      sac took longer than usual to absorb. The other egg with the
      cellophane on it hatched a week later and that baby was perfect.
      Though this egg business can be very strange, it is also<BR>
      endlessly amazing. I can't wait to see what other egg oddities
      lie ahead.</FONT></P>
