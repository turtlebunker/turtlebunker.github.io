      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our FALL meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, October 22nd at the Robbie Waters Library</B>
      (7335 Gloria Drive 95831) from 5 until however long you want
      to be there.  There will be pre-hiberation checkups so feel free
      to bring your pets but please keep them in boxes and don't allow
      them to crawl on the floor.  It's also our Pot Luck meeting so
      bring a dish to share!! Thank you all in advance.  If your pet
      is already asleep, please don't wake him up.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I dislike this time of the year
      because our turtles and tortoises begin slowing down, eating
      less, sleeping more, even if the weather gets warmer, they continue
      to slow down and then the gloomy cold foggy day comes and that
      is when most disappear under the ground.  This is ok if they
      are a hardy species like three toed box turtles and the Mediterranean
      tortoises whose natural climate is very much like our very own
      in Sacramento and vicinity.  It's really best if you know where
      they are.   Truthfully, I never know where the Greeks and Hermann's
      or Russians have gone to.  Some go underground;  others simply
      go into the many doghouses I have around the yard and can be
      seen peeking out on sunny days.  They are not about to miss a
      single day of living above ground.  But they are not eating.
       Sometimes some of them do want a snack and I do give it to them
      because this is not Boston and it is not likely to snow and freeze.
       By 2 in the afternoon, they are snuggled back into their shelters.
       On gloomy days, you won't see them at all.  Of course, there
      is always the exception!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Very often, if you see one above
      ground in the middle of winter, it is probably not feeling well.
       Don't rush it inside immediately,  SLOWLY bring it indoors into
      the garage first and then a cooler room in your home and finally
      into the warmest part of the house and try to determine what
      is wrong.  Are the eyes swollen?  Has he lost a lot of weight?
       Is he limp?  Is the nose running?  Eyes sunken in?  Put the
      tortoise in some shallow water to encourage drinking because
      perhaps he or she is simply dehydrated.  Sometimes they will
      empty their bladder during hibernation and become uncomfortable.
       This will give you a chance to clean up the hiberation box in
      case they have made a mess in it.  Take a peek and see if there
      are any worms in the box, maybe on the the newspaper (if you
      used it) or underneath.  It's so hard to tell what is going on.
       You should not feed the tortoise unless you decide to keep it
      awake.  You could consult a vet with experience with turtles
      and tortoises or I can put you in touch with some of our club
      members who have even more experience!!  We can talk about how
      to keep your pets awake and eating indoors during the winter
      months at our Fall meeting.  Bring your ideas and photos!!</FONT></P>

      Betty and Bill with their desert tortoise, Tillie, Tania brought
      her desert tortoise, Luigi, to show off, Tracy and Steve brought

      As usual, this place was a madhouse from March until?? (It's
      still nuts here, people visit almost every day!)   On another
      note, we never did rescue any of the turtles from the McKinley
      Park pond or the Land Park ponds.  The plans kept changing and
      it seems if someone went to the shelter at the right time, they
      could have a turtle or two.  Before things fell apart, I acquired
      the names of at least 50 people who were willing to take some
      of the now homeless turtles into their outdoor ponds.  I've used
      a few of those people to adopt mine to since the deluge never
      ends and these did not come from the ponds, but were found running
      through the streets of Sacramento or turned in by people who
      could not care for them anymore.  Unlike dogs and cats, turtles
      can last up to 50 years.  In fact, it won't be long before I
      am looking for new homes for the menagerie here.  In fact, I
      am seriously considering having someone come over once or twice
      a week to help since there does not seem to be any stopping the
      amount of turtles being turned in to the hotel for 'awhile',
      hospital, because they are sick or injured,  hospice, because
      they are not going to survive their injury or illness, orphanage
      and maternity ward. Any amount of time spent here is worth it
      for what you will learn and the entertainment provided by the
      tortoises, mostly the Greeks and Hermann's whose energy never
      ceases.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Of course I can't write this
      part of the newsletter without making everyone queasy.  It did
      happen.  And it was my fault.  I was showing off again.  There
      was a gentleman in the yard picking up a tortoise to bring home
      and he was admiring the Greek tortoises who kept walking around
      his feet, hoping for a snack or two and allowing their heads
      to be petted.  I thought he might enjoy being abused by Zappo
      the Wacko who was nearby but whom I had placed in a special area
      so he wouldn't be running free in the yard attacking people's
      feet.  Mistake #1 - I was wearing open toed sandals.  Mistake
      #2 - I let him out to make love to the man's shoes.  Mistake
      #3 - I stopped paying attention  and the next thing I know there
      was a sudden terrible pain on the side of my big toe on my right
      foot.  ^#$%#$ Zappo got me!!  It was deep and it hurt and it
      would not stop bleeding!  I had to sit down on the porch step
      and I wrapped it as tight as I could with some paper towels I
      grabbed out of the kitchen.  The gentleman said, &quot;are you
      allright?&quot;  And I was honest and said, &quot;I don't know&quot;.........(I
      truly was scared!)  But I wrapped it up really tight and put
      a sneaker on and escorted the man to his car and smiled, etc.
      and wished him good luck with the tortoise.   After he drove
      off, I limped back into the house and laid down for awhile, cussing
      myself for being so stupid.  It's been five weeks.  You can tell
      something happened to my toe, but it's much MUCH better and Zappo
      is still not loose in the yard and won't be until it's time to
      wear boots again!! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And that's about it from The
      Bunker.  Please keep in touch over the winter months and express
      any concerns you have regarding your pets.  Have a wonderful
      Holiday season and hopefully we can have another Round Table
      Pizza Party Meeting on January 14 or so.  Thank you for all of
      your support throughout the years.  How time flies!!!</FONT></P>
