      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The very cool summer weather
      brought on a change at The Bunker. It was too cool for mating
      (except for the Hermann's tortoises, of course) and egg laying
      among the box turtles hardly occurred. Early in the season, the
      three female Hermann's tortoises laid a total of 27 eggs. I was
      lucky to have seen each clutch laid*. Out of the 27 eggs, three
      hatched from the first batch. They were sluggish, would not eat
      and had poor color and did not live long. I was crushed. One
      of Mother Nature's tricks, I suspect. No other eggs were fertile.
      Maybe next year??</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty, our Russian Meteorologist,
      played a dirty trick on me one day. I was making my &quot;rounds&quot;
      of the yard and suddenly saw her in a strange position. She was
      next to a dog house with her head down in a dark corner with
      her rear end sticking straight up and she was not moving. My
      heart sank. I assumed she was dead. %#$@%$#. Since I couldn't
      reach her, I found a long stick and reached in and poked her
      leg. She moved and I jumped out of my skin! She reminded me of
      a photo Paula Morris once published in THE BRIDGE of her own
      Russian tortoise in this same weird position, casually asleep.
      When it comes to turtles and tortoises, expect the unexpected!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another male Greek has arrived
      at The Bunker and has joined the other Bad Boys of Summer in
      the Greenhouse which includes Just Jim Junior, Just Jim the Jerk
      and a very naughty Holy Hermanni. I have to keep them confined
      during the summer months because of the severe harassment they
      inflict on the other residents who are trying to enjoy their
      peace and quiet. Each time I allow one outside of the Greenhouse,
      he will immediately start chasing and biting the first tortoise
      that he sees. I guess it is something they are compelled to do?
      Does anyone have a male Greek tortoise who is NOT aggressive
      towards other tortoises?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">* On Labor Day, I spotted a baby
      Hermann sunning in the yard. Obviously a clutch was laid two
      month previously while I was on the job. I hope I can find the
      rest, if there are any? The location of the nest is a mystery
      but I will not mow the lawn anytime soon!</FONT></P>

      For those of you who keep tortoises indoors for part of the year
      this should help you save time and trouble when cleaning the
      enclosures and changing substrate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I keep my T.kleinmanni in indoor
      kiddie pools in the winter and in bad weather. Since I use a
      soil/sand substrate that would normally be hard to dump and scrub
      clean, I use my &quot;quick-change&quot; method when cleaning
      cages. The secret is using a plastic liner. I buy huge rolls
      of black plastic 9<BR>
      mil liner. The rolls I buy are 10 feet by 100 feet of black liner.
      These are usually sold in the painting tarp aisle at the local
      hardware store. The size I buy runs around $24.00, which isn't
      bad when you consider you get 100 feet of material. I cut the
      plastic to fit the kiddie pools then lay them over the pool,
      leaving excess liner hanging over the edge. Then I pour my substrate
      onto the liner. You may have to press the liner down to get it
      to lay perfectly flat. Once the substrate is in place, set up
      your environment for your torts. When it's time to change the
      substrate, simply pull the liner up and tie it at the top like
      a garbage bag and start again. This saves so much time. You will
      no longer have an adequate excuse for not changing your animals'
      substrate regularly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The turtles and tortoises will
      be slowing down from now on. It is very natural so do not worry
      if your pet is not eating as much or at all. Even though the
      days are warm, the nights are longer and colder which is bringing
      on this phenomenon. I can't tell you how many well-meaning folks
      take their pets to the veterinarian who then shoot them up with
      antibiotics and vitamins for no reason except to &quot;do something&quot;.
      Often the keeper is then instructed to shove a feeding tube down
      the tortoise's throat and start the force feeding process. All
      of the stress, all of the expense and all of the work and worry
      and there was nothing wrong in the first place - but once you
      upset Mother Nature's scheme of things, you unleash her fury
      and end up with a very sick pet. Don't assume that non-eating
      is a symptom of a dreaded disease. Don't do anything extraordinary.
      But watch for other symptoms such as swollen eyes and a runny
      nose. In the absence of that, let your tortoise be a tortoise
      and let your turtle be a turtle!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For three weeks before the Turtlerama,
      I had to go to work. The weather was quite warm at that time
      and I had a very rough time not knowing how to keep the tortoises
      fed and clean all day not to mention the fear of any tumbling
      upside down in the sunshine which happens frequently due to mating
      and fighting activities during the summer months. If I put food
      out the night before, the tortoises would know it and come out
      and eat it up at midnight. I know eggs were laid, but I don't
      know where. I need your input. If you work and have turtles and
      tortoises, how do you manage? How do you know that the neighborhood
      cats or blue jays have not eaten up the turtle's food<BR>
      before they had a chance at it? Please share your stories with
      us. Let us know how you do it. I'll publish the results in a
      future newsletter. Your input will be greatly appreciated.</FONT>
