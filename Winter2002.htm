      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our next meeting, the Slumberama,
      will be held on Saturday,  January 18th at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge
      Road from 1 until 3 pm or so.  No guest speaker has been scheduled
      so feel free to come up front and give a presentation about your
      favorite turtle or tortoise.  Do you have a favorite? Tell us
      why it is so special and stands out above the others.  Did you
      buy this turtle or tortoise in a pet shop or did someone give
      it to you or did you get it through our adoption program?  Did
      you hatch it yourself?  What endearing characteristics does it
      have?  And, by the way, please remind me of your adoption request
      often so if something comes in that you want, I will know you
      are still interested. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I once said to a friend, &#147;I
      need to lighten my load and give away some of my turtles&#148;,
      and she asked me which ones I would be willing to say good-bye
      to.  I looked at the tortoises, Fat Betty, the Just Jims, Clyde,
      Claire, Chester, Ellen, Tarzan Jr. and Tillie and I gazed at
      the box turtles, Tootsie, Sparky, Mr. Ed the Redhead, Roger and
      Rita and I also glanced over at the water turtles, Molly, Frances
      and many other unnamed sliders.  I can honestly say I&#146;m
      very attached to them all and it would be difficult to part with
      any of them.  I&#146;d say they are all my favorites!  Even Tyson!

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Baby turtles are showing up in
      pet shops all over town.  If you see any, please let me know.
       We can&#146;t stop the illegal pet trade but we can encourage
      proper care so that the turtles have a chance at survival through
      our care sheets.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Does anyone know how to grow
      your own worms?  For a city girl, I&#146;ve had my share of luck
      raising mealworms and redworms and if I can do it, anybody can.
       I&#146;ll be happy to share my techniques with you at the meeting
      so that you&#146;ll always have a supply on hand.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you have any expertise in
      this matter, please help me out.  I&#146;m sure there are many
      different ways to achieve healthy worms. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks to all for your beautiful
      Christmas cards, some with photos, kind words and extra dues
      enclosed.  You are so wonderful and the club is a success because
      of you out there and your kindness and generosity.  I wish you
      all a very Happy and Prosperous 2003!</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">January can bring some warm days
      so be on the lookout for box turtles sitting out in the sun.
       Do not feed them or disturb them.  Just observe them for swollen
      eyes or bubbly noses.  Sometimes their eyes are closed and may
      look swollen, but they are not.   Water turtles generally sit
      around the pond on sunny days as well.  They normally have their
      eyes open as they bask.  If one has the eyes closed and seems
      to be making a sound as if it is clearing its throat every few
      minutes, it may have pneumonia.    Many turtles come out of hibernation
      in February and if the weather gets cold again, will go back
      to sleep until the weather warms up.  Do NOT bring them indoors
      unless it is clear that they are sick and if you do bring them
      in, do it slowly.  It&#146;s too much of a shock to take a cold
      turtle into a warm house.  Sick turtles usually sit out all night.
       Watch for that. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here&#146;s my remedy for water
      turtles&#146; respiratory ailments:  You will need a package
      of Ornacycline antibiotics for birds and some eye droppers, all
      available at any pet shop.  Dissolve a piece of a tablet in enough
      water to be able to zoop it up into the eye dropper.  Here&#146;s
      the fun part.  Hold the turtle facing you and rub the eye dropper
      along the jawline.  This should trigger him to open his mouth
      to bite at which time you will squirt in the liquid.  It doesn&#146;t
      seem to matter how much or how little goes in as long as SOME
      goes in.  You can often get them to open their mouth by tugging
      on a front leg as well.  Do this treatment for 5 days and then
      see if the turtle is any better.  If not, then do it for another
      5 days.  They are usually all well after the first 5 days.  If
      you can&#146;t get the turtle to open its mouth, then dissolve
      the tablet in a little bit of water and let the turtle soak in
      it for a few hours a day.   Good Luck!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Soon after our October meeting,
      I had two visitors.  Kay Booth and her daughter, Christy.  Kay
      wrote the book, &#147;Forty Years With Tortoises&#148; (which
      is still available).  I gave them a tour of the yard and as I
      approached the greenhouse, I noticed one of the leopard tortoises
      upside down.  I stepped inside while Christy held the door, and
      a moment later Christy exclaimed, &#147;There&#146;s a baby tortoise
      in there&#148;!  I looked down and thought I was dreaming.  There
      on the ground was a baby leopard tortoise and next to it was
      another one.  My mind was spinning.  Where did they come from?
       I put Blondie in there in August when she appeared to be ready
      to lay her eggs &#150; which she did but I dug them all up &#150;or
      did I?  Obviously not!!  After my guests left, I went back into
      the greenhouse and looked carefully for more and I was not disappointed.
       One was on the ground across from where the original two were
      found and as I bent down to pick it up, something caught my eye.
       On the shelf, three feet above the floor, was Number 4!  How
      did he get up there?  He must have climbed up the thick Bermuda
      grass that had taken over inside of the greenhouse.  It became
      a convenient ladder, but he could easily have fallen through
      the spaces and gotten hurt.  I guess he hatched under a lucky
      star. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I write this, the other eggs
      from that batch have not hatched in the incubator*.  I may have
      to change my incubation technique and simply place the eggs into
      the greenhouse during the summer because they obviously hatched
      very quickly at 100 + degrees, a definite no-no in all literature
      on incubation. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There was a Christmas Miracle
      at The Bunker.  I keep the smaller sliders who hatch naturally
      in the yard in a water filled plastic tub with water hyacinths
      to sit on and I place a piece of screen over the top as protection
      from birds or other predators.  About two months ago, I noticed
      that the smallest slider was no longer there.  I looked all over
      and could only assume that a bird had taken him out of the container
      while he was sunning himself since the screen didn&#146;t completely
      cover the tub.  I could have kicked myself for not being more
      careful.  On December 14, during a terrible wind and rainstorm,
      I stepped out to bring food to the greenhouse tortoises and before
      going in, with my hand on the door, I spotted something on the
      ground in front of me.  Yep.  It was the missing baby, safe and
      sound.  I picked him up and gave him a big smile and a hug and
      returned him to his container and he quickly swam to join the
      others.  It is a miracle that he lived on his own for so long
      without being run over by the lawn mower, stepped on, picked
      up by birds or eaten by the bigger turtles and frogs.  I simply
      can&#146;t understand the things that happen here.  Why was he
      sitting in that exact spot when I went out to feed the tortoises?
       Why did I look down?  And if you haven&#146;t had enough miracles,
      here&#146;s another one.  *One of the leopard eggs hatched in
      the incubator on Christmas day.  He is from the batch that I
      dug out of the greenhouse last August.  Several more are hatching
      now. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I hope we don&#146;t have too
      much more rain this winter.  I know we need the water, but Fat
      Betty is still in that hole in the back yard and I&#146;ve put
      a large piece of wood over it.  I&#146;ll be happy to see her
      sweet face again in March.</FONT></P>

      told her it would bite.  That turned her off.  I couldn&#146;t

      animals because she obviously thought he could.</FONT></P>
