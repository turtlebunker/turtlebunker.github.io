      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, April 23rd</B> at the <B>Belle Cooledge Library</B>
      (corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge Road) from 1:30 until
      4. Our guest speaker will be fellow club member, <B>Michael Rajkumar</B>.
      Michael is going to give a presentation on the importance of
      proper diet in captivity and also explain the significance of
      some of the common greens. He would also like to cover the importance
      of humidity in the enclosure for young hatchlings and also proper
      hydration. In addition, Michael would also like to cover the
      problem with commercial turtle/tortoise foods, even the ones
      with low protein content. It sounds like we are going to have
      a very informative meeting. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I would like to thank <B>Richard
      Spekner </B>for coming to our winter meeting and giving a fine
      presentation. It was wonderful to see healthy turtles in the
      middle of winter and listen to Richard&#146;s animated discussion
      of the different species. THANK YOU RICHARD!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We can talk about any number
      of topics as time permits at the meeting, so please bring your
      questions. And don&#146;t forget to have your incubators ready
      because eggs can be laid at any time now. Quality raffle items
      (turtle related, of course) are always needed and many thanks
      to Robin Kaneshiro once again for her wonderful donation of assorted
      sale and raffle items. It is so appreciated!!</FONT></P>

      winter we had was a bit hard on our pets because the temperatures
      never got cold enough for true hibernation. The box and water
      turtles all came through with flying colors, however, several
      Russian tortoises who were outside did not survive. A lot of
      Russians had been turned over to The Bunker. I call these the
      Petco Russians since this is where they came from. People bought
      them not realizing the care that was required. The ones I put
      into the Greenhouse in the fall did very well. Many times a turtle
      or tortoise will seem to have survived hibernation only to perish
      when the temperature goes up. I believe this happens when they
      are so weak and no longer have any reserves to fall back on.
      They were not really hibernating this winter - they were using
      up their energy. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sacramento winters are so changeable.
      Some years it is perfectly safe for the Russians to hibernate
      outdoors, but other years are deadly and even Fat Betty cannot
      accurately predict the weather. A lot of mine go underground
      before I can catch them and they usually are ok, but once in
      awhile, there is trouble. And I hate when that happens. Considering
      the phone calls I am receiving, quite a few of your pets did
      not survive what was considered to be a mild winter. A colder
      winter would have been much better for them. Let&#146;s try to
      learn what we can from this.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is now time to clean up the
      yard, get rid of the debris, mend the fences, plant some seeds
      and watch out for predators. Sometimes I think it is better to
      keep our turtles indoors considering the dangers outside. Raccoons,
      opossums and rats are always a threat. When I take the Leopard
      tortoises out of the Greenhouse for the spring and summer I often
      ask myself, &quot;What am I doing??&quot; I worry less in winter.
      They are safer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Marilyn, a male Greek tortoise,
      has joined Just Jim Jr. And his friends and considering Marilyn&#146;s
      not unexpected weird behavior, I have appropriately gave him
      the last name of Manson. He arrived &#145;sick&#146; with several
      syringes full of antibiotics for me to administer. I never saw
      the runny nose he was supposed to have and let him join the others
      since he was a captive to begin with. After being released into
      the habitat, he immediately began chasing the female Greeks and
      was about to claim one as his own when Hercules, a larger male
      Greek, stepped in and pushed him off. Most often these last weeks
      tho, the scene I observe is the female Greek traveling quickly
      across the yard with Marilyn Manson right behind her and Hercules
      bringing up the rear. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It&#146;s good to see this normal
      activity after the incredibly long winter for the Greenhouse
      residents. During the wet and foggy month of January, Blondie
      decided it was time to lay some more eggs. She would walk off
      of the heat mat and start digging in the cold dirt and then get
      chilled and sit in one place until I went out and put her back
      onto the pad. Did I ever tell you that I found a baby Leopard
      in the Greenhouse last fall? It must have come from an egg I
      missed digging up and I have no idea how it survived among the
      large leopard&#146;s activities and major BM&#146;s. But survive
      it did. What&#146;s very interesting is the color of its shell.
      Instead of being the normal Leopard black and white, it is the
      color of the dirt, sort of a sandy brown, like a Sulcata hatchling.
      Mother Nature disguised the hatchling to match the substrate
      in the Greenhouse.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It finally happened. A tortoise
      escaped from The Bunker. It was seen heading towards the neighbor&#146;s
      swimming pool. The only problem is: how did it get there? I see
      no holes under the fence and it didn&#146;t climb over and I&#146;m
      thinking, maybe it isn&#146;t mine? In light of this, is anyone
      willing to help secure my yard? I think the back fence needs
      a good going over.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A small red eared slider was
      presented to me with a huge lump on her neck. Ordinarily I do
      not lance these lumps because I don&#146;t want to be bitten.
      The family had no extra money for a vet, so I was it. I had a
      feeling a vet would have anesthetized the turtle, possibly killing
      it, in order to get at the lump. I made the decision to try and
      did not promise any miracles. It took 2 days for me to gather
      my courage and one night, at midnight, while the turtle was fast
      asleep, I laid out my instruments. I knew I had to work fast.
      I knew I would only have one chance. I grabbed the turtle and
      swiftly lanced the lump without cutting off my own finger and
      got out as much gunk as possible. The head shot in, never to
      be seen again until morning! I never did get another chance and
      sent the turtle home with instructions to bring her back should
      the lump get really big again.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Lots of times, water turtle neck
      lumps are unsightly, but don&#146;t present any problem unless
      the turtle has trouble eating. The Bunker is busy now, everyone
      is awake and ready for another season of eating, mating, eating,
      mating and eating and mating.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Give your pets a general checkup
      when they come out of hibernation. Watch the way they walk. They
      should not be limping or dragging themselves along the ground.
      The eyes should be wide open and bright and shiny and not sunken
      in. The weight should be adequate for the size. If you pick up
      a box turtle and it feels hollow, you know it is dehydrated and
      needs extra attention. Are the nostrils clear? Sometimes wetness
      clears up after a nice long soak. Is the turtle hungry? They
      usually don&#146;t eat until the temperatures are in the 70's.
      Check for skin conditions. If it looks and smells bad, it usually
      is! A white looking ring around the eyes usually means the turtle
      or tortoise could use a warm soak. I do hope all of your troubles
      are minimal. Don&#146;t let things get out of hand. Happy Spring!</FONT>
