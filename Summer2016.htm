      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Summer meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, July 16th</B> at the Robbie Waters Library
      (7335 Gloria Drive 95831) from 5 pm until ????  However long
      you'd like it to last.  We have the room until 10 pm.  Some of
      you complain about not being able to bring your pets to the meeting,
      well, it is recommended NOT to bring them into the meeting room,
      but you can certainly bring them and admire them <U>outside</U>.
       It will be light out until about 9 pm and that gives us plenty
      of time to meet, greet, talk, eat and enjoy each others pets.
      <B> *The next group to meet are parents and their toddlers and
      you certainly would not want your child or grandchild crawling
      on a floor a tortoise has previously soiled.*</B> Nobody cleans
      up in between since it is the weekend.  Please bring your questions
      to the meeting so we'll have something to talk about.  And if
      you don't have any, then we'll just sit around and talk and eat
      and laugh which is fine too.  However, there are often new members
      or interested people in the room who might feel left out - so
      please consider them???  And don't forget the more shy members
      who are there to listen and not talk.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I do not know what is ahead for
      the McKinley Park turtles.  By the time you receive this newsletter,
      perhaps everything will be resolved?  For those not in this area,
       a local pond in a park is being renovated and the City Council
      wanted all of the turtles euthanized.  Due to the outcry, it
      was then decided that we, as a group, could begin taking the
      turtles out of the pond and foster them and then return them
      when the work was done.  That would have been the NORMAL and
      RIGHT thing to do.  I was put in the position of finding homes
      for the newly homeless turtles flung out of the pond where they
      were born, since TEAM is a legitimate adoption program.  I have
      an abundance of new homes available but......stay tuned for the
      rest of the story!!!!  And keep in mind that the only place the
      turtles are non-invasive is IN THE PARK POND!!!  Nobody is listening
      to me!!  And people will fill it with turtles again in no time.
       That's just the way the world is!!  People love the turtles
      there!!!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Well, back to the club...............would
      you like to have the <B>Fall and Winter meetings</B> in the pizza
      parlor?  I do like the Round Table in my neighborhood because
      it has the large meeting room for 60 people and the doors close
      so it is very private.  We do not HAVE to buy food but who wants
      to be there and not eat and drink???  And it is NOT that expensive.
       I believe there were 35 people attending in January and the
      cost was about $90 + a tip and that was not a high price for
      so many people and the club is treating!!  What could  be better???
       And we can have our raffle.  And we can meet all afternoon.<BR>
      I'm in, are you????            </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I had something wild and shocking
      happen here.  Last December 23, Blondie, the leopard tortoise,
      laid 6 eggs which was pretty normal for her and they were placed
      in the incubator and on June 26, right on time, after being in
      the incubator for 5 months, the eggs began to hatch.  1, 2, 3,
      4, 5, 6, - 7????? 6 eggs and 7 babies???  I thought I was not
      counting right. and it took several minutes to realize that I
      had <B>TWINS</B> in there.  Something I NEVER expected to see
      in my lifetime or (gulp) take responsibility for.  With a little
      help from You Tube and my OWN instincts, they survived and I
      don't want to go into great detail here but most of it was documented
      on our Facebook page.  I will answer your questions personally
      if you like.  It was a very frightening 7 to 10 days because
      they were squirming so much so I decided to keep them in the
      dark/warm incubator a lot to keep them quiet.  And FINALLY everything
      was dry enough to separate them.  WHEW!!  If this happens under
      your watch, please trust your instincts and not what others tell
      you to do which could lead to their death. Patience is everything!!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Zappo the Wacko</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> continues his vendetta against men,
      women and children of all ages.  Sometimes I forget about him
      when I have guests At The Bunker and then I hear a scream and
      my heart sinks.  More than one person has said,  &quot;OUCH,
      THAT LITTLE SOB&quot;!!!  He will be at the Turtlerama to entertain
      and abuse as many unsuspecting people as possible.  And most
      people will love the abuse!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The excessively hot weather has
      caused mostly the Hermann's tortoises to go into a complete frenzy
      looking for someone to love.  And they are very selective - looking
      at one tortoise in front of them - realizing it is not the 'right'
      one and continuing on and on actually running at top speed until
      they find their mate.  And then - the chase is on because the
      females (at least here) want nothing to do with the annoying
      males.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The only way you can ever have
      fertile eggs is if the female miraculously becomes trapped somewhere
      and can't get away.  You have to really love and understand these
      tortoises to appreciate their personalities.   They are very
      entertaining.   The sad thing is this:  In spite of all of this
      activity -nobody lays any eggs.  I never give up hope tho.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I hope you are all enjoying the
      summer months and not forgetting the very cold wet winter we
      went through.  There were losses here but I don't see anything
      that I could have changed to prevent this from happening.  Remember,
      most of the time, you don't know your tortoise or turtle is sick
      until it dies.  And that hurts!!  Guilt!  But you have to go
      on or else, give up and collect turtle figurines!! </FONT></P>

      </B>what turtles and/or tortoises you plan on bringing or if
      you are willing to help members with their exhibits.   I do have
      two spare canopies I bought for the club and am happy to share
      but you'll have to pick them up here before going to the event.
       I'll bring refreshments and there's plenty of places to eat
      and rest right there if you need a break.  Please bring your
      extra plants if you have any, for us to sell as they seem to
      be very popular. <B><I><U>Any donations to the sale table will
      be MOST welcome.  SEE YOU ON THE 16th!!</U></I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sometime in between the meeting
      and the Turterama, I will have another <B><U>Box Turtle Blowout</U></B>,
      there are some here I'd love to sell PLUS people have left cages
      and aquariums here that are clogging up the place and making
      me look like a hoarder.  At one point, I had THREE of those 'tortoise
      homes' lined up against the wall by the garage.  I have two huge
      aquariums that have to go. Use them for your plants or bearded
      dragons!!  (PS - I will need 'stuff'for the raffle on the 16th......Thanks
      in advance!)</FONT>
