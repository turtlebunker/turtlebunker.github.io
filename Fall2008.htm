      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday,  October 18th from 1:30 -  4 pm </B>at
      the Belle Cooledge Library located at the corner of South Land
      Park and Fruitridge Road.  (5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822
      for those who want to Google it.)  It is our annual pre-hibernation
      meeting and<B> Father Dimitri </B>will be on hand to look at
      your pet and decide whether or not it should be allowed to hibernate.
       <B>Michael Rajkumar</B> will be giving a talk about the importance
      of proper lighting for indoor setups.  He will cover selecting
      an appropriate UVB/UVA source; the importance of full spectrum
      lighting and the importance of the CRI &amp; LUX values.  Afterwards,
      we can discuss what to do with your hatchling tortoises and box
      turtles to keep them healthy throughout the winter months.  Some
      people allow them to hibernate their first year but I always
      wait until they are at least 3 years old before trying it.  We'll
      talk about the critters you have in your back yard and if they
      hibernate in the wild and address your concerns.  Summer goes
      by so quickly.  I'm never ready for this.  Are you?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's also our<B> POT-LUCK </B>meeting
      so bring something for everyone to eat, even better if it can
      be in the shape of a turtle.  And we can have another turtle
      Halloween Costume contest since it seems to be a popular event.
       Let's see what you can come up with this year.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarded hibernation, it reminds
      me of a phone call I received a few days ago.  A woman called
      about  an African Sulcata.  She wanted to adopt one from me.
       She told me that hers 'hibernated' every winter.  It would go
      under the couch in October and come out in March.  I asked her
      where it was now.  &quot;DEAD&quot;, she said.  I asked her who
      told her it hibernates.  &quot;The guy in the pet shop.&quot;
          BE ALERT!!!!  Use your common sense.  Do not believe what
      you read on the Internet.  95% is totally wrong and deadly. 
      All you have to do is research where your pet originates from
      and mimic its environment.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Turtlerama was tremendously
      successful thanks to all of YOU who made it happen.  I heard
      that people were parking three blocks away!  It was a very busy
      and hectic day for all.  Shirley, you were super at our sale
      table!!  Our exhibitors included:  Nancy, Michelle, Sharon, Chris
      and Ernestine, Mark, Suzanne and her son Adrian, Jennifer, Glenn
      and Susan, Kasey, Craig, Michael and family, Joy, Mary, Raul,
      Sherri and Linda.  (Apologies if I left anyone out). We had quite
      a few plants donated, a bunch coming from Angie and Linda.  Thanks!!
       The assortment of turtles and tortoises on display was fabulous
      and a large Sulcata named Thunder was walking around for awhile
      for all to enjoy.  Special thanks to long-time club members,
      Jim and Suzi who helped out tirelessly wherever needed from 9:30
      until 5 pm.  I've never seen anything like it.  You were terrific
      and I hope you can return for the Turtlerama 28 next year!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Did you know that we had a table
      at the Reptile Show at the Convention Center in September?  Thanks
      to <B>Jeremy of Pets To Go and Upscale Reptiles </B>for allowing
      us to be there and thanks to Michael, Tracy, Julie and Craig
      for manning the busy table for the two day run.  We didn't have
      any turtles there, just information about the club and some care
      sheets and a 'display board' I'll show you at the meeting. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I want to thank Michael Rajkumar
      for his good advice regarding my overgrown backyard.  I had asked
      for help cutting the weeds down.  &quot;The tortoises love hiding
      in it&quot;, he said.  &quot;I can hardly find mine&quot;...so
      I thought it over and he was right.  The tortoises LOVE hiding
      in the tall grass.  Even the box turtles who were clever enough
      to escape their pen were hiding back there.  Of course, none
      of them knew that I could see them.  I guess nobody mows in the
      wild, right?  So why should we?  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I wish you all a very safe and
      healthy hibernation.  Please call if there is a problem or you
      are confused.  Just remember:  <B><I>NEVER LET A SICK TURTLE
      OR TORTOISE HIBERNATE AND NEVER LET A HIBERNATING TORTOISE GET
      WET. </I></B> (Also wishing you all a Happy Holiday Season)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim Junior and Just Jim
      the Jerk, the Greek tortoises, were at the Turtlerama and never
      stopped showing off for the crowd.  If anyone put their beloved
      pet in the pen with them, they immediately launched their attack.
       The victims were quickly removed.  Any food offering, however,
      stopped the assault.  They are no different at home and have
      to live with the box turtles where there is no friction.  I do
      have a lovely female Greek who is a perfect match for them. 
      She arrived here totally flat and soft from living in an aquarium,
      but after two years of outdoor living, now looks fairly normal.
       The above named males pay no attention to her whatsoever.  They
      are only into violence and if they were human, I know they would
      be serving life sentences in San Quentin Prison!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Life at The Bunker became a little
      easier after the Turtlerama.  Some very large sliders had been
      turned in for adoption.  They seemed to be been 'wild', but it
      wasn't long before they began, timidly at first, eating and soon
      after, unashamedly begging for food everytime I walked by.  I
      had three extra kiddie pools set up and I could have used Jim
      and Suzi every day to help dump the dirty water out and refill
      them.  It doesn't usually happen, but I found myself beginning
      to become attached to them, especially the big girl who was almost
      blind and shunned all food and human contact when she arrived
      in a box from the SPCA.  When she went to her new home, she was
      better than new and very friendly, as were the others.<BR>
        <BR>
      There is something I must share with you.  At the summer meeting
      in July, you all heard me announce that someone had phoned needing
      a home for her parents 2 Sulcatas,  &quot;12 to 18 pounds&quot;,
      the daughter said.  &quot;My parents want to travel&quot;.  
      They lived up north, a three hour drive away.  Some of you took
      down the phone number.  Six days after the meeting, the couple
      drove the tortoises down to my house since I told the daughter
      that those sizes would be no problem for me to hold until I found
      them a new home.   When the couple arrived, we exchanged greetings
      and then the gentleman opened up the trunk of his car and there
      sat the two Sulcatas.  One weighed 60 pounds and the other weighed
      80 pounds.  I expressed my surprise at their size and told them
      I was not expecting anything that large and I really couldn't
      accommodate such huge creatures in my small yard.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My words fell on deaf ears and
      the tortoises were put into my wheelbarrow, one at a time, and
      placed in the back yard.  Like Godzilla, they began to walk destroying
      everything in their path.  My own tortoises looked like ants
      next to these guys.  The wife was taking pictures of the tortoises
      and began to cry.  I looked up into the sky.  She couldn't bear
      the thought of leaving her tortoises behind.  I smiled up to
      the sky.  The tortoises were heading towards the greenhouse,
      almost pushing the big heavy bricks into the pond and smashing
      down the fence surrounding the 'turtle hotel' that had been there
      for 25 years.  Without a word, the man (with sweat pouring down
      his face since it was 104 degrees) picked them up, one at a time,
      put them back into the wheelbarrow, and then back into the trunk
      and they headed home.  I was unnerved for days, even having nightmares.
        The 80 pounder had a strange protrusion from his lower jaw.
       It looked like a spear jutting out, it was at least 5 inches
      long.  I advised them to have it removed at once because he could
      inflict a serious injury to the other tortoise or  a person unfortunate
      enough to be in the way.  It was not a good thing!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The days are getting shorter
      and colder and Blondie and her friends will soon be in the greenhouse
      for the winter months.  The summer was not hot at all except
      for a few days.  But let's hope it was warm enough for our pets
      to get enough to eat to see them through the hibernation period.
       Time will tell.</FONT></P>
