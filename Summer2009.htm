      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on Saturday, July 18th at the Belle Cooledge Library,
      5600 South Land Park Drive 95822, from 1:30 until 4. The meeting
      will be followed by the <B>TURTLERAMA</B> four weeks later so
      please let me know if you are planning on exhibiting your pets
      or educational materials or helping out or both. If you want
      to change anything about the show, let me know. I am always open
      to new ideas and displays. <B>Joyce Trimingham</B> has made up
      some beauties recently. Please sign up at the meeting or call
      or email me with your plans. It is appreciated.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For July's meeting, however,
      let's have a good <B>Show and Tell</B>. We usually try to have
      this event but somehow are too busy talking about other subjects
      and before we know it, the meeting is over and we have to get
      out of the library so they can lock up. I plan on bringing Chester,
      the ancient Elongated tortoise who, on warm nights, comes out
      of hiding and walks around the yard looking for bananas (his
      favorite food) and sets off the Driveway Patrol. You know the
      rest. I am out there in my nightgown with a flashlight looking
      for a predator. Please bring your favorite turtle or tortoise
      and share your story. In addition, <B>Michael Rajkumar </B>and
      I would like to discuss <B>parasites</B> and also ask what will
      happen to your pets if something happens to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting was very well
      attended. I can't mention the amount of people in the room for
      fear the library staff will never let us in again for exceeding
      the limit. We had a wonderful time. I cut the 28th Anniversary
      cake and gave a piece to everyone. Since this was time-consuming,
      <B>Dimitri </B>came to the rescue again and spoke on a variety
      of subjects including praising the club for its simplicity and
      helpfulness and friendliness. With your encouragement, I do go
      the extra mile for our shelled friends. When I mentioned that
      nobody would ever be elected to anything, a huge cheer went up
      in the room. That must be the secret to our success!!</FONT></P>

      on the lawn.<BR>
      Egg laying continues in July and even<BR>
      into August if it is warm.<BR>
      Mist the box turtle enclosures. If they<BR>
      develop swollen eyes they could be <BR>
      dehydrated from lack of humidity.<BR>
      Check your pets often to make sure<BR>
      none are upside down. <BR>
      Put a spring closure on your gate.<BR>
      Please install a simple Driveway Patrol<BR>
      to warn of predators in the yard.<BR>
      If you must fertilize your lawn, water it<BR>
      well for three weeks before letting your<BR>
      tortoises walk and graze on it.<BR>
      Don't Look for Information on the Internet!</FONT></I></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is the same old story here.
      I have been inundated with big red-eared sliders as has our unsung
      hero, <B>Marilyn Flynn</B>, who put in a new larger pond which
      quickly filled up with the huge ones she was picking up from
      Animal Control. Our own turtles have been suffering because of
      this and even dying of strange diseases. It is a nightmare.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Susan Tellem</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">, who founded the American Tortoise Rescue
      in Malibu and also proclaimed World Turtle Day to be May 23rd
      each year, wrote a letter to the F&amp; G Commission stating
      that she is accepting no more sliders and that the F&amp;G will
      have to deal with this monumental problem right now instead of
      putting it off for another 20 years or more. Our waterways are
      clogged with sliders and by our 'rescuing' them, we are enabling
      the authorities to simply continue to do nothing. Marilyn and
      I will follow Susan's lead. We will continue to take in pet turtles
      for adoption but not the ones who very obviously came from the
      Oriental markets where they were awaiting being butchered alive
      after being taken from our southeastern states. Many people buy
      them and simply let them go in order to save them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, here At The Bunker,
      the on again off again warm weather has the turtles and tortoises
      in their usual tizzy. We can't force them to eat but as I write
      this in late June, the nights are around 60 degrees and everyone
      is eating and feeling perky and there is lots of mating going
      on. I am baby sitting a group of young female Greek tortoises.
      Enter <B>Just Jim the Jerk</B>. He was especially naughty this
      spring, hauling off and chasing and biting the leopard tortoises
      as they quietly grazed. He continued to chase the small Sulcata
      who has the prolapse problem now and then and even though he
      could push and bite back, he never has. One day I stood in the
      middle of the yard with Jim in my hand. I had to put him somewhere.
      But where? It was too hot in the greenhouse. I can't be cruel!
      It's a small yard with not much space. I looked at the little
      Greeks. Should I? Could I? I did!! I put Jim in there with the
      girls and there was an immediate change. He became <B>Just Jim
      the Gentleman</B>. In that enclosure, he is very quiet and eats
      side by side with them. Jim no longer can bite the heels of all
      of the tortoises who are running away from him. For now, it's
      wonderful! But how long will it last?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I had something interesting happen
      in the incubator a few months ago. While washing off Blondie's
      eggs before incubating them, one slipped out of my hand and cracked.
      Yes, I felt like a murderer but I quickly grabbed some glue (Duco
      cement was handy) and a piece of gauze and poured the glue on
      the egg and stuck the gauze on it while telling myself how stupid
      it was to do this. I expected it to explode in the incubator.
      Well, it didn't explode. The baby hatched!! In fact, it was the
      first egg to hatch. The next day, I discovered another had hatched
      and was struggling with a piece of the shell adhered to its nostrils.
      Boy oh boy, I'm glad I saw that before it was too late. It's
      always something. Fat Betty is fine and getting even fatter.
      She did lay some eggs, but they are never fertile. None of the
      boys pay any attention to her. As the old song goes, &quot;I
      don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me........&quot;
      I am looking forward to a long and very hot summer. I see you
      all rolling your eyes out there, but it's best for our pets.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Due to popular demand,
      Shirley Waterman has Reeves eggs incubating. The hatchlings will
      be available sometime in September @ $35 each. If you want to
      get on the list, email her at watermans@att.net and put 'turtles'
      on the subject line or call and leave a message at: 916-371-6868.
      These hatchlings are always very healthy and active.</FONT></I></B></P>
