       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our mid-winter meeting which
      I&#146;ve dubbed the &#147;Slumberama&#148; will be held on <B>Saturday,
      January 19th </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library from 1 until 4.
       The library is located on the corner of Fruitridge Road and
      South Land Park Drive.  It is easiest to get there from I-5.
       Take the Fruitridge Road exit and go east for a few blocks.
       So far, no speaker has been scheduled and since this is a very
      casual meeting, we can break off into different discussion groups
      and I&#146;ll bring along a few of Andy Highfield&#146;s videos
      if anyone is interested in watching.   Let us know how hibernation
      is coming along and how your non-hibernating turtles and tortoises
      and hatchlings are doing.  If time permits, Joy Cornette or I
      will read &#147;The Old Turtle&#148; to the children and the
      grownups can listen as well.  Please try to bring your funniest
      or oddest turtle related Christmas gift to the meeting.  I&#146;m
      sure you all got more than your share of them.  Of course, if
      you got doubles, you can always donate them to the raffle or
      sale table.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had three wonderful speakers
      at our crowded Fall meeting.  Sally from Grass Valley discussed
      her ups and downs regarding her desert tortoises, how she got
      started and her current status with them, which was on a positive
      note.  We&#146;ve all had our share of troubles with desert tortoises
      and sharing the information certainly helps prevent future problems.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Joy Cornette gave a very informative
      talk and slide demonstration regarding the new Ultra Violet bulbs
      out in the market today.  Zoo Med sent me a sample of their new
      sun bulb after reading in our newsletter that there would be
      a demo at the meeting so it looks like we are not all destined
      to rely on Vita Lites for our full spectrum lighting. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Richard Spekner also came to
      the meeting from his home in Brentwood and brought along a wide
      variety of exotic water turtles, each one unique and utterly
      charming and happy and healthy.  Richard is very knowledgeable
      regarding the care and feeding of each turtle, in fact Richard
      has a pet shop in Antioch called PET&#146;acular EXOTICS.  The
      address is: 1312 Sunset Drive, Antioch, CA  94509.  Phone number
      is:  1-925-755-4377   FAX 1-925-753-5392.  They are working on
      a website and we&#146;ll let you know when it is ready for viewing.
       The store carries many different species of turtles and tortoises
      including S.E. Asians, Indonesians, Cherry head redfoots and
      even Burmese tortoises.   Richard will go out of his way to help
      you with any problems you are having in a very competent and
      often humorous manner.  We&#146;ll try to have him speak at a
      future meeting.  The store also carried other reptiles and tropical
      and saltwater fish. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thank you so much for your beautiful
      Christmas cards, many of which were filled with dues and donations
      and are appreciated more than you will ever know.  Some clubs
      are demanding a $50 donation from a person donating an animal
      to them to cover vet bills, etc.  Thanks to all of your donations,
      we would NEVER have to resort to doing something like that which
      could lead to animals simply being discarded or allowed to die
      because the person does not have the money to spare.  The Turtles
      and I wish you all a Very Happy and Prosperous New Year.  Thank
      you all for your continued support. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The large snapping turtle living
      in the garbage pail in my back yard is continuing to thrive in
      spite of her environment.  I&#146;m waiting for a suitable home
      to become available out of California.  She can&#146;t be mailed.
       She&#146;s too big.  She&#146;s also very spoiled now and if
      you approach the garbage pail and look in on a nice warm day,
      she will want to eat and will unexpectedly leap up and scare
      you to death.   Just ask Craig Gifford who innocently looked
      in.  The smile on her face soon changed to sudden fear as she
      jumped back and screamed.  I enjoyed it.     The desert tortoise
      with the broken leg seems to be almost completely healed.  He
      is still here at The Bunker because I didn&#146;t think it would
      be wise for him to hibernate.  Did I tell you that the family
      dog  picked him up by the leg and shook him violently.  OUCH!
        I know you love your doggies, but never trust them alone with
      your turtles and tortoises.  Not even for a minute.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Around the time of the last meeting
      in October, it was time to put the Leopard tortoises and a few
      Elongatas back into the greenhouse for the winter.  They do enjoy
      their winters in there, feeling the warmth of the heat pad on
      their tummies.  Since it was still fairly warm during the day,
      I was in the habit of turning off the pad in the morning and
      turning it back on at night.  Halloween night arrived, with a
      beautiful full moon glowing in the sky.  The children were Trick
      or Treating and it was a fun filled night for all.  After the
      doorbell stopped ringing, I went about my usual chores.  I washed
      my hair and wrapped it in a towel.  I also put on a nightgown,
      made a cup of hot tea and sat at the kitchen table with my bare
      feet propped up on a chair and started to read the paper while
      waiting for my hair to dry.  It was after 10 pm by this time
      and quite cold outside.  I sipped my tea and at some point my
      thought processes finally kicked into gear.  I remembered that
      the heat was off in the greenhouse.  It only takes a few minutes
      to run outside, turn on the switch and run back inside again.
       One of my cats always accompanies me.  So out I went, with wet
      hair and a nylon nightgown and bare feet.  I opened the greenhouse
      door and almost fell over Blondie, the Leopard tortoise who was
      sitting on a nest she had just completed digging and I could
      see 6 eggs in the hole.  As usual I stood there not knowing what
      to do.  Should I leave her alone?  No, it was too cold.  Was
      she done laying the eggs?  I had to take a chance.  I removed
      her from the nest and put her on the heat mat and then in this
      flimsy nightgown, wet hair (the towel had fallen off by this
      time) and barefoot with a cat purring madly around my legs I
      bent down and carefully took the six very slimy eggs out of the
      mud hole nest, put them into my hand and then ran back across
      the lawn to the house (yes, I had turned the heat pad on).  I
      washed the eggs off in lukewarm water and placed them into the
      incubator.  I then had to clean myself off and went to bed and
      turned the electric blanket on high to warm up.  After all of
      this trouble, I hope the eggs hatch.  I&#146;ll let you know.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A lot of activity is taking place
      inside of my house this winter.  I&#146;ve had red-eared sliders
      turned in before, but never this many.  I&#146;d say there&#146;s
      no more room at the inn!  My husband asked me why so many people
      give them up.  It&#146;s mainly because the turtles were given
      to a child as a pet.  The child then grows up and goes away either
      to college or gets married or simply leaves home and the parents
      do not wish to spend the rest of their lives taking care of the
      turtles.  Almost all of them have been kept in an aquarium, therefore,
      they can&#146;t go outside during the winter because they would
      die.  They have to remain indoors until springtime.  It&#146;s
      a lot of work taking care of these guys.  Water turtles make
      a mess of water quickly and the smell is awful.  Aquariums are
      difficult to clean so I prefer plastic containers, which are
      easier to dump out and refill.  But I&#146;ll deal with it until
      I can find good homes for them.  Just about everyone wants a
      desert tortoise but nobody wants a red-eared slider.   Please
      consider adopting one or more of them, but only if they will
      live outside.   Aquariums are for fish!</FONT></P>
