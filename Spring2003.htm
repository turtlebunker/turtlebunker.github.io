      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will be held
      on Saturday, April 12th from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library which is located on the corner of South Land Park and
      Fruitridge Road. Father Dimitri will be our guest speaker and
      he will discuss seasonal problems (such as coming out of hibernation
      and proper hydration of your turtles and tortoises) and will
      discuss stimulating breeding activity and preparing for egg development.
      It will be a very interesting and informative talk.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By now your turtles and tortoises
      are probably completely out of hibernation, although some can
      take longer than others to emerge. There are always a few who
      refuse to eat even though they appear to be healthy. Check the
      non-eater thoroughly. Bad signs are a runny, bubbly nose or half-closed
      or even completely closed eyes and lethargy. Carefully look for
      lumps, bumps or ticks or a hidden wound, which would be infested
      with maggots. Make sure no limbs are missing. It&#146;s amazing
      how well they hide wounds. SLOWLY turn the turtle or tortoise
      over. Is the head limp and wobbly? This is definitely not a good
      sign. If the head retracts and has good muscle tone, it is an
      encouraging sign. If the turtle has a B.M., examine it for worms.
      Urine should not be a fluorescent blue color. If it is, call
      your vet immediately.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If everything looks ok, then
      be patient. Sometimes things have changed in your yard and your
      turtle is aware that something is different. The familiar &#145;landmarks&#146;
      are not where they used to be. I&#146;d like to remind you never
      to take anything out of the enclosure, if at all possible. Do
      not move rocks or logs that the turtles are used to climbing
      over or hiding under and never move their water dishes. You can
      add to the environment, but once things are set in place for
      awhile, please try to leave it alone. Make sure your non-eater
      drinks water every few days to prevent dehydration and by the
      middle of May, they should all be eating well.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mealworm Farming &#150; It&#146;s
      So Easy!!</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Stop paying high prices for mealworms
      when you can grow your own very easily. You&#146;ll need a wide
      plastic container (I never found a lid necessary since the worms
      can&#146;t climb up the smooth plastic sides). Buy some wheat
      bran in the health food department of the supermarket or a health
      food store. You can add chick starter to the bran if you want
      to which is available at feed stores and some pet shops. I have
      used oatmeal successfully as well. You&#146;ll need to buy a
      container of mealworms at first to get started and after a few
      weeks, you&#146;ll see an amazing number of baby mealworms in
      the culture. For food, every few days add sliced potatoes and/or
      carrots and refresh it as necessary. If the container starts
      to smell, simply start over. Never let it get wet. I keep mine
      at room temperature all winter but out on the patio for the summer.
      It&#146;s especially useful to have your own mealworm farm if
      you have baby box or water turtles. They love the tiny mealworms.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT THE BUNKER</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker was a busy place indoors
      all winter. Around Christmas, Blondie&#146;s (the Leopard tortoise)
      30+ eggs began hatching. There were three clutches in two homemade
      incubators. Eggs don&#146;t always hatch at once, so each day
      I had to check the incubators to see if anyone had hatched and
      the fun began when I set them up in separate containers in the
      spare bedroom and they refused food for several weeks. It&#146;s
      amazing how something the size of a walnut can drive you nuts.
      Eventually, one began to eat and then the others followed suit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On February 25th, Fat Betty emerged
      from her hole in the ground. I was so happy to see her sweet
      little face. She was dirty and slightly damp but apparently in
      good health. I placed her in a safe area away from the spot she
      was in and I then filled the deep hole up with dirt and at one
      point my shovel touched something that was definitely not a rock.
      Oops, it was a box turtle who obviously decided not to hibernate
      in the safe enclosure but to climb out and bury himself in the
      tall grass where I mow.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The leopards in the greenhouse
      are very ready to come out to enjoy another season of sun and
      fun. They certainly &#145;know&#146; when the time is right and
      become restless and run to the door to escape whenever I open
      it to enter or throw in some food. It&#146;s always a relief
      to let them out into the yard again, although the danger of predators
      is a constant worry to me as it is to all of you. We have to
      be on the lookout at all times for raccoons, possums, rats and
      dogs. Birds can also steal our babies before we even have a chance
      to find them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All of the Just Jims (The Greeks)
      and Joltin&#146; Joe (the deformed Marginata) have come out of
      hibernation as well as the Hermanns &#150; all waking up at the
      same time and carrying on as if they never slept at all. Isn&#146;t
      it wonderful to see our old friends once again every spring?
      I hope all of yours have come through it safely.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are an abundance of beautiful
      red-eared sliders here. Most of them were raised in aquariums
      but have outgrown them and are ready for the great outdoors.
      I am happy when people turn them in for adoption because living
      in an aquarium is no life for a turtle of any kind. Living in
      an aquarium is like being in prison and the bigger they get,
      the more confined they feel. So it is best to let them go into
      an outdoor pond before they grow grotesque or wither and die.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Make Your Own Incubator</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All you need is a Styrofoam ice
      chest, a small electric hot rock, a piece of stiff mesh screening
      (sometimes called &#145;hardware cloth&#146;) and a large cup
      of water. Place the hot rock on the bottom of the ice chest.
      Create a &#145;shelf&#146; by placing the screen on the ledge
      that is inside of the ice chest. The screen should fit snugly
      all around so a hatchling cannot fall through accidentally. Place
      a large cup of water next to the hot rock and make sure it does
      not go dry. Place the eggs in a tray (I line mine with dry green
      moss) and put a thermometer by the eggs. Put the tray on the
      ledge and then put the cover on and every few weeks, peek in
      to see if everything is ok and there&#146;s no bad smell. The
      dry moss would be for tortoise eggs. For box or water turtles
      I would add wet moss and keep it wet throughout the incubation
      process. GOOD LUCK!<BR>
