      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Slumberama meeting will be
      held on <B><U>Saturday, January 21st from 1 until 3:30 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library (South Land Park &amp; Fruitridge Road).</U></B>
      Not much happens at this mid-winter meeting when everyone is
      asleep or wishes they were. Of course, there are turtles and
      tortoises awake indoors for the winter months for many reasons.
      If you have any tips to share, we would be very interested in
      hearing about them. I have many hatchling tortoises indoors in
      boxes and had to be very creative in order to keep them warm
      and not have high heating bills. I use an electric &#145;throw&#146;
      blanket on an empty bed and that is their source of heat. It
      is set on &quot;low&quot;. It&#146;s not perfect but it&#146;s
      the best I can do. Any other ideas would be appreciated. My cat
      also enjoys lying on the warm blanket. Me too, sometimes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the weather is bad on Jan.
      21, we will cancel the meeting. &#145;Bad&#146; means foggy,
      windy and rainy. If in doubt, please call me, ok? Also, our <B><U>April
      22nd meeting will be our 25th</U></B></FONT></P>

      celebrating, please let me know and if you don&#146;t, then it&#146;s
      up to me to surprise you. So where did the last 25 years go to?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was wonderful.
      Many of you had your turtles and tortoises checked out by Father
      Dimitri. I do hope they are enjoying a restful hibernation if
      they were given the ok. Bobbi Bartley, myself and Michael Rajkumar
      were standing by to help but Dimitri had the last word. We owe
      Dimitri a huge THANK YOU for not only patiently doing all of
      those checkups but getting up to give us a hibernation lecture
      as well. What would we do without you??</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks to all who brought food
      for our pot luck. Everything was delicious!! No leftovers!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mid-Winter Tips:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Start planning your tortoise pen improvements
      ASAP because, believe it or not, within 6 weeks, those cute little
      box turtle faces will be peeking out of the ground wondering
      if it&#146;s time to get up. When the trees start blooming in
      Sacramento, it&#146;s time. If you spot any babies, please bring
      them indoors, but not all at once. They hatched outside and are
      used to the cold. It&#146;s not safe to leave them outside because
      the parents could eat them; birds can carry them off and worst
      of all, you could step on them. You never want to hear that crunch
      and if you do, you hope it&#146;s a little branch or an acorn.
      Repair your fences - this is something I need to attend to. Remember,
      if your turtles and/or tortoises can see the other side, they
      will want to go there! That&#146;s just the way they are. You
      have to stay one step ahead at all times.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding<B> Hurricane Katrina</B>,
      we have club members, John and Pat Martin who live in <B>Slidell,
      Louisiana</B> which was devastated due to the flood waters. I
      was so relieved to get a letter from them a few weeks ago. They
      told me what happened to them when the 7 foot high wall of water
      flooded their home. I will read the entire harrowing letter to
      you at the meeting. I will tell you that they had 67 turtles
      and tortoises before the flood waters hit and now only have 6.
      The 6 were the African Sulcatas who drifted off in a large tub.
      The largest, Sidney, weighed about 85 lbs. Stacy was about 40
      pounds and the other three, Sandy, Suzy and Sherry weighed about
      20-25 pounds each. They were found <B>two months</B> later -
      still in the tub - and apparently in good health in spite of
      having lost some weight. John &amp; Pat survived the hurricane,
      but then the water came. If you&#146;d like to send them a card,
      please send it to me and I&#146;ll forward it to them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">During the hot summer months,
      turtles become very active and display a good deal of energy.
      This is especially apparent when I enter one of my caged areas
      to feed my turtles. As I throw trout pellets into the water,
      several turtles led by the Japanese Reeves leading the pack,
      tend to forget all about eating and prefer to chase me around
      the pond. I have to wonder if they get anything to eat since
      a number of other turtles are eating the pellets. Apparently
      they must because they always seem to have plenty of energy to
      chase me around.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Anyways, I decided to have some
      fun with them a few days ago and started walking back and forth
      from one side of the square pond to the other. I did this about
      eight or ten times and they were still chasing me back and forth
      as fast as they could possibly swim or walk. Some of them were
      on the wooden walkway which is about a foot wide and I had to
      step over them to walk back to the other side. This did not deter
      them in the pursuit of me. If I stopped, some of them would crawl
      up my leg and one in particular would bite my pant leg. I am
      sure that I could win first place if I sent a video to &quot;America&#146;s
      Funniest Home Videos&quot;. Put my turtles to work and earn some
      money. Not a bad idea! This is only one of several peculiar episodes
      that occur every summer with my crazy turtles and I still need
      to get it on film!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another interesting tidbit about
      turtles is their ability to distinguish between their keeper
      and other people. They tend to show no fear of me, but let another
      person enter the back yard with me and they all take cover. This
      tends to make it difficult to film them so I&#146;m sure a blind
      would be needed to get some really good video of them in action.
      Maybe someday!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The above was written by Marvin
      Bennett, President of the Turtle and Tortoise Club of Florida
      in the September 2005 issue of their newsletter, &quot;Turtle
      Tales&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Marvin&#146;s last paragraph
      certainly applies to what happens At The Bunker all of the time
      when &#145;strangers&#146; come to visit. ALL of the water turtles
      dive in and stay down until they are certain it is safe to surface
      again. As we peer into the pond, their cute faces appear slightly
      below the surface and they swiftly back down again with a clap
      of their front paws. When I am alone, sitting by the pond, most
      of the turtles let me pet them. The box turtles don&#146;t seem
      too affected by strangers and although the tortoises might appear
      to not be aware, I can see them slowly retreating (especially
      the Leopards) while breathing so heavily that they wheeze. People
      often ask if they have colds and I have to tell them that they
      are being &#145;inspected&#146;. Some species, like the African
      Sulcatas and the Russian tortoises will run to people hoping
      for some food to appear.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The residents of The Bunker
      and myself hope you had a very nice holiday and have a Happy
      and Healthy New Year. Thank you all so much for your lovely cards
      (many with dues PLUS) and words of encouragement. Without all
      of you, there would be no club.<B> THANKS A MILLION!!</B></FONT></I>
