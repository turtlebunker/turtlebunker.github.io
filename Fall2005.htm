      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, October 15th </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library
      located on the corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land Park
      Drive from 1 until 4. Last Fall, Father Dimitri set up a table
      outside of the library meeting room for the pre-hibernation checkups,
      and it was clear that most of you preferred to be outside waiting
      in line to have your animals checked out. Only a handful of people
      were inside and we didn&#146;t have what you could call a meeting,
      so, if it is ok with you guys, let&#146;s have a pre-hibernation
      clinic instead of a formal meeting. We can have our pot-luck
      and munch and mingle and have our resident experts, including
      Father Dimitri, give our pets the checkups to see if they are
      healthy enough to hibernate. Please let me know if you can donate
      your time and have the expertise to give advice on different
      species. I would like to have three or four people inside the
      meeting room doing the checkups. We will have our sale table
      set up and also hold the raffle around 3 pm. We have been receiving
      wonderful items for the raffle &amp; sale table for which I thank
      you so very much. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Little did I know on the morning
      of our summer meeting what was in store for all of us. I went
      to the library early in January to secure our meeting room dates
      for 2005, however, this time the branch manager neglected to
      note the dates in the library log and ended up double booking
      the meeting room. When we arrived for the meeting, we were dismayed
      to see that another group was already settled into &#145;our&#146;
      room and we were left outside in the <B><U>107degree heat! </U></B>There
      were about 70 of us with no place to sit except two small stone
      benches. Since we are all troupers, we decided to stick it out
      for awhile. We were standing and sweating out front in the shade
      which didn&#146;t help much. We chatted and there were refreshments
      thanks to Shirley Waterman. Eventually we were offered a few
      tables and a couple of chairs for those who needed to sit. Thanks
      to Ashley, Tammy Vigon&#146;s wonderful daughter, for using her
      great voice to quiet everyone down so we could have a 10 minute
      &#145;meeting&#146;. I could not go over any plans for a better
      Turtlerama tho. Maybe next year? We did have our raffle which
      was enjoyed by all and I thank you all for sticking around on
      that hot hot hot day. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B>TURTLERAMA</B> was a huge
      success thanks to all of your help. It usually follows the reptile
      show downtown by a few weeks and I enjoy telling people that
      they can buy turtles and tortoises at the show and learn how
      to take care of them at our Turtlerama. Several people called
      after attending the reptile show because they heard they could
      get free turtles from me. They were all sent adoption forms and
      I need to remind you of what I have said repeatedly. When you
      fill out an adoption form and send it in, please call or email
      me OFTEN to inquire about it. If I never hear from you, how do
      I know you are still interested? Some people think I give turtles
      to my &#145;friends&#146;. Not true. The person who gets the
      turtle is the one who is always calling! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We have a new club member. His
      name is <B>Anakin</B> and he was born on September 6 and the
      proud parents are Michael and Sara Rajkumar. He joins sister
      Pepper. We are looking forward to meeting Anakin at our fall
      meeting! CONGRATULATIONS!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The summer flew by. My favorite
      time of the year took its time getting here and after 4 weeks
      of heat it was gone leaving the residents of The Bunker wondering
      what happened. &quot;Where&#146;s The Heat?&quot; I could almost
      hear the box turtles saying. I am hoping for a long Indian Summer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The best thing that happened
      was at the Turtlerama when Craig Dinger came up to me and asked
      if there was anyone who could give the tortoise he had in his
      hand a new home. I stared at the creature he was holding. It
      was a very old male Greek tortoise. His shell was totally black
      and very smooth. He had gnarled bumpy skin on his limbs and long
      grotesque nails on his back feet. I took the tortoise and felt
      like I was holding a reincarnation of Just Jim. I told Craig
      I would take him home and enjoy caring for him. The next morning
      I came into the kitchen and opened the patio door. I heard a
      strange clacking sound outside and a faint squeaking noise as
      well. I went outside to investigate. Yes indeed, the old Greek
      tortoise had dug up an ancient tortoise corpse and was smooching
      the area where a face used to be. I just stood there wondering
      if I was really awake. It was something I never thought I would
      see again. I came back into the kitchen. My husband asked what
      was going on. &quot;Nothing&quot;, I replied. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Xango is here. What is it? It&#146;s
      a delicious and nutritious fruit juice which one of our club
      members sent to me to try on sick turtles. The juice is for humans,
      of course, but someone had good luck giving it to a sick turtle
      and so did I. A box turtle who had not eaten all summer began
      eating with great gusto after I put a few drops in his mouth
      each morning for three days. Another box turtle ate a large nightcrawler
      after only one dose of the juice. I am trying it on some of the
      sluggish tortoises and will report the results at the meeting.
      You can read about the juice on <A HREF="http://www.mymangosteen.com/bardell">Barbara&#146;s
      website</A>.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many of the box turtle residents
      are rehearsing for hibernation by digging in underneath their
      dog houses. I have no idea why they insist on doing this each
      year and no matter how hard I try to prevent it, they manage
      to do it anyway.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I&#146;ve been cleaning the greenhouse
      in preparation for the winter months and Blondie has decided
      to lay her eggs in there again. I will dig them up because the
      time of hatching would be around January and they would not survive.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Do not allow your pet to hibernate if
      it has been sick or injured during the year. It is normal for
      appetites to slow down drastically from now on. If your turtle
      or tortoise has been eating and acting normally up until this
      time, it&#146;s ok to let it hibernate. However, if the eyes
      are swollen and the nose is gushing, you may want to keep it
      awake and treat these ailments which tend to get worse in the
      winter. Sometimes, however, the tortoises <B>insist</B> on sleeping
      no matter how hard you try to keep them awake. In this case,
      if it&#146;s not too seriously ill or congested, allow it to
      hibernate for 6 to 8 weeks but not outdoors. This goes for hatchlings
      as well. Keep them fairly dark and cool (in a closet perhaps?)
      60 to 65 degrees would be just about right. For the turtles and
      tortoises outside who must come in for the winter, tropical and
      African species, start bringing them in when the nighttime temperatures
      are 50 degrees or lower. Remember, it&#146;s not how cold it
      is, it&#146;s how long it is cold. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many turtles and tortoises try
      to escape as hibernation time approaches. This is normal behavior.
      They will climb and dig and be upside down because of this activity.
      Try to discourage them by blocking their view of the other side
      of the fence. If they can&#146;t see out, they usually don&#146;t
      try to get out. Be very alert at this time and put a spring on
      your gate so it will slam shut if someone forgets to shut it.
      Please register your desert tortoises with the F&amp;G so that
      they can be returned if they accidentally escape from the yard.
      Put the tag on the tortoise and not in your drawer. I can send
      you the tag application. Other tortoises can be identified by
      a return address label super-glued to the shell. Do not get any
      glue on a seam.</FONT></P>
