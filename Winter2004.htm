      </FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our next meeting, the Slumberama,
      will be held on Saturday, January 22 at the Belle Cooledge Library
      from 1 until 3. The library is located on the corner of Fruitridge
      Road and South Land Park Drive. If there is heavy fog or rain,
      we will cancel the meeting, so please call if you are not sure.
      Richard Spekner arrived too late to give a presentation at our
      last meeting, and I&#146;m going to ask if he can bring some
      turtles to this meeting to talk about. He has a great collection
      at his Brentwood home and owns the PET&#146;acular Exotics pet
      shop in Antioch. It is a one stop reptile shop and you can call
      him at 925-755-4377. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We will have snacks and a raffle,
      however, we are getting very low on quality raffle items. Please
      see if you have anything you would like to donate to a good cause.
      All proceeds go into the Sick Turtle Fund. We would like to see
      your turtle related Christmas gifts as well. I have three ready
      to show for your enjoyment. And if you&#146;d like to donate
      yours to the raffle, that would be great, altho the person who
      gave it to you might not appreciate it. (We&#146;ll never tell!!)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Let&#146;s give a huge THANK
      YOU to Father Dimitri who came to the Fall meeting and set up
      his pre-hibernation clinic outside of the library room on a very
      windy and cold afternoon. He patiently inspected each turtle
      and tortoise presented to him and gave excellent advice to the
      owners. There was a long line of people waiting for his examinations
      and they all said it was well worth the wait. Several of you
      donated money to Dimitri, but he would not dream of accepting
      it and we then applied it to the Sick Turtle Fund. The Club thanks
      you very much for your kindness and generosity.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">SEE YOU ALL AT THE MEETING.
      WE&#146;LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET!! <BR>

      is the time to read all you can about the species you have and
      perhaps what you might want to own in the future. It&#146;s best
      not to mix species so try to keep each type in its own enclosure.
      And don&#146;t overload your yard with too many creatures. You
      won&#146;t be able to enjoy them due to all of the work you&#146;ll
      be doing to keep them clean and fed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Raccoons and possums are doing
      a lot of damage this winter. I dread the heartbreaking phone
      calls I receive. Don&#146;t know what bit off your turtle&#146;s
      legs? A possum will usually eat the entire turtle out of its
      shell. But a raccoon will leave it maimed, bleeding, suffering.
      And it will be near a source of water because raccoons like to
      wash their food before eating it. I had a huge rat invasion in
      the yard last fall, but no turtles were harmed. They seemed to
      be going after the corn on the cob I would leave out for the
      turtles after they polished off all of the grapefruits in my
      tree. It was a frightening experience. They would come pouring
      out of the tree at sundown. Keep your eyes open at all times.
      The Driveway Patrol works very well to alert you if a predator
      is out there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thank you all so much for your
      wonderful Christmas cards, many with dues PLUS enclosed which
      is greatly appreciated. I wish you all a very Happy New Year
      and I hope all of your dreams come true. We are entering our
      24th year and I owe all of the success to YOU. Without your constant
      support, we would have evaporated long ago. We have made life
      much better for so many turtles and tortoises and I hope to continue
      for many more years. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I write in the middle of December,
      it is obvious that Fat Betty has no intention of hibernating.
      Word has spread throughout The Bunker and her Russian, Greek
      and Hermanni friends along with several box turtles have decided
      to join her in the afternoon sun each day. Nighttime temperatures
      have been in the low 30's but it does not mean anything to them.
      50 degrees seems to be the deciding factor when it comes to hibernation.
      If the temperature stays below 50, 99% of the turtles and tortoises
      will stay alseep, but once the temperature climbs to 50 or above,
      they come out to bask for the day. All we keepers can do is watch
      and keep our fingers crossed and hope for an early Spring - which
      this behavior indicates. If your turtles are also doing this,
      don&#146;t worry about it and do not feed them. You only have
      to worry if they don&#146;t seek shelter after sundown. That
      means they are not feeling very well. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Inside of the Greenhouse, Blondie
      seems restless this winter, pacing about as if she would like
      to lay eggs again. But she goes back onto the heating mat as
      the sun goes down. Tarzan Jr., Clyde and Chester seem content
      as do the assorted small Sulcatas that have been turned in for
      adoption.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">They were upset at being in a
      cardboard box indoors. In the greenhouse, they can roam around
      and I believe they think they are outside. <BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Throughout the winter, sliders
      arrive on my doorstep because they have gotten too large for
      their aquariums in which they should not be kept in the first
      place or the people are moving or it was their child&#146;s pet
      who has now gone off to college.............I smile and take
      them in. I was able to acclimate quite a few to the outdoor ponds
      before winter hit but now it&#146;s too late and the new ones
      must stay indoors until the weather warms up. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And so it goes throughout these
      long dark winter months. We miss our pets so much. We wonder
      how they are doing. We wonder if perhaps we should have kept
      them awake. We kick ourselves for being lazy and letting them
      hibernate. We worry and then we worry some more when it is raining
      or freezing. But then - one day in late February or March, we
      see one or two of our friends again, sitting out in the sunshine
      and we know we did the right thing. I will forever be impressed
      at how they withstand the rigors of winter. They are so small
      and winter is so big.<BR>

      <P><B><I><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Carapace Pitting in
      Terrapene </FONT></U></I></B></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">by Darrell Senneke </FONT></I><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(<A HREF="http://www.chelonia.org/">www.chelonia.org</A>)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One of the most common health
      questions relating to wild caught captive American box turtles
      relates to the presence of small pits on the carapace. These
      are most typically found in three-toed box turtles, Terrapene
      Carolina triunguis. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are a number of different
      reasons given anecdotally for the presence of these pits. One
      of the most prevalent of these is that they are the result of
      the use of tongs by hunters as they dragged the turtle out of
      its hibernation quarters or its burrow. While this supposition
      is attractive as it both calls attention to the collection of
      a species in the wild and the related cruelty of the same, it
      has no bearing in fact. Yes, Terrapene are collected from the
      wild, often in non-sustainable numbers and yes, this is a practice
      that we do not support in any way. The usual placement of the
      pits as well as the presence of many of these on specimens examined
      in the wild lays that theory to rest. As further evidence against
      this theory is the fact that wild Terrapene are collected in
      numbers generally by picking them up from country roads after
      rain or by using tongs during collection. The symmetric nature
      as well as the location of the markings discounts the source
      of them being dogs or other wild animals. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another theory is that this is
      a result of mating behavior, the usual placement of the pitting
      corresponds closely with the placement of the front feet of males
      during mating. Males also will often mount other males during
      combat in the same manner. Keeping in mind that the keratin of
      a turtle&#146;s shell is living tissue, it requires no extraordinary
      leap of logic to reason that the shell after enduring small scratches
      in the seam between the scutes will over time develop small infections
      resulting in the pits, even on males.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The only problem in the above
      theory is that it does not explain why this pitting occurs almost
      exclusively in T.c.triunguis rather than all Terrapene, who mate
      and engage in combat in the same manner. It is the opinion of
      this author that mating and combat does have a partial responsibility
      for the pitting but that there is something else specific to
      the environment of T.c.triunguis that capitalizes on the scratching
      of the carapace resulting in the pits. In any event, no treatment
      is required. The pits are natural and their exact cause is unknown.</FONT></P>
