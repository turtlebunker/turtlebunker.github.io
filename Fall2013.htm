       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Our Fall meeting will be held on <B>October
      26th from 1:30 until 4 </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library, 5600
      South Land Park Drive, Sacramento, CA  95822.  Father Dimitri
      Grekoff will be on hand to conduct pre-hibernation checkups and
      I suggest bringing your pet in a box and having a list of your
      cares and concerns ready to speed up the line a little.  If your
      pet is already hibernating, please don't wake him up and bring
      him.   As many of you know, it's also our pot-luck meeting so
      bring a dish for everyone to enjoy and if there are leftovers,
      feel free to take them home and most of all, PLEASE help clean
      up the food mess on the floor before you leave.  We have to leave
      the room as clean as we found it and the library personnel are
      trying to avoid an ant problem.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We'll be discussing hibernation
      so this is the time to ask those questions.  We do have 99% of
      the answers.  Just make sure you don't try to hibernate a tropical
      tortoise or turtle.  For example, red and yellowfoot tortoises
      do not hibernate nor do Sulcatas and Leopards.  Something else
      to consider is whether or not to let hatchlings of hardy species
      hibernate.  Some people always do, other people never do.  It's
      totally natural, so why keep them awake?  On the other hand,
      they could die........see?  If you want to go crazy, this is
      the time of the year to do it.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We'll also try to help you decide
      how to keep your non-hibernating tortoise awake and happy all
      winter, it's always an emotional topic because a lot of us think
      of our pets as human babies and can't stand the thought of them
      sleeping for months without food or water and cold cold cold.
        </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In addition to turtle and tortoise
      talk, I'm going to add a little extra kick to the meetings. 
      Since most of you are very interested in cactus and succulents,
      I am going to reserve a little time at the meeting for some cactus/succulent
      talk.  I'll bring a specimen to talk about, maybe for someone
      to guess what it is and then put it on the raffle table?  Or
      I can be bribed as well if you can't live without it.  We could
      share cuttings.  The possibilites are endless.  I can't wait!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting was terrific
      with about 80+ people in the room and it was followed quickly

      to thank who either were helpers or exhibitors.  So thank you

      and Russian tortoise and for answering all of those questions
      all day.  Thank you Michael Rajkumar for helping everyone physically
      and others with their turtle/tortoise questions and I know we
      kept Dimitri busy as well.   Whew!  If I left anyone out, please
      forgive me and let me know and I'll add you to the next newsletter.
       It was a rather hectic busy day.  The plant sale was a huge
      hit as well and thanks to all who brought them including Ruby
      Nakano and Angie Tamantini via her son Steve.  There's even more!
       Kevin brought baked goods for us all and a million thanks for
      Ernestine and Chris for making the dirt cakes with gummy worms
      with and for the children (grownups too!)  There was also seed
      planting and painting of turtle pins to take.  Susan Seljuk,
      thanks for helping me all day; Jon Wato, I hope you sold some
      Russians and Jackie, thanks for bringing Thunder (Sulcata) to
      chase after Sweet Pea!  He's grown large since we last saw him.
       Kira, thanks for helping me compile this list and Chase for
      helping and Ruby and Alan Nakano for coming by the day before
      to help me set up the room.  I'm reliving the whole day as I
      type and am getting very tired!    Looking forward to next year's
      show!!!  Are you????                 ****NEXT MEETING AFTER THIS
      IS JANUARY 25, 2014****</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As usual, the summer months flew
      by so fast and a lot of box turtle eggs were laid and some are
      beginning to hatch as I type this newsletter.  On a sad note,
      a much awaited Asian (or Chinese) box turtle finally hatched
      only to quickly die of a ruptured yolk sac.  Unfortunately, things
      like this happen for no reason.  The other 3 eggs appear to be
      empty.  But I'll keep them in the incubator anyway because nobody
      ever really knows.  When they shrivel or worse, explode, then
      it will be time to discard them.  The Asian eggs are not usually
      laid in a normal manner.  The females don't dig large enough
      holes.  I don't know if they are in a hurry or are lazy, but
      they will use another turtle's nest to place their eggs in leaving
      them half sticking out of the ground as well.  Some simply lay
      the egg on top of the ground and walk away.  If you are not there
      to see it, another turtle will quickly come along and eat it.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The usual nonsense continues
      with Just Jim Jr. (Greek) making a complete fool of himself chasing
      and trying to mate with any male tortoise, the bigger the better
      and sometimes going after Blondie, the large leopard.  I don't
      know where he gets all of his energy from since he seems to eat
      very little and I've never seen him drink any water and he has
      been here over 20 years.  He'll grab a bite or two if I fling
      the food in front of his face as he is running after someone.
       He spends a lot of time (for his own good) in a prison which
      is a dog kennel I bought at my neighbor's garage sale.  It is
      more roomy than the old jail.  He has more room to move about
      in this one and seems to relax in it and perhaps feels it is
      his 'home'?   It takes the pressure off of his victims too. 
      They will withstand the abuse for a certain amount of time before
      either running away;  turning around and butting him back;  (notice
      I said 'butting' and not 'biting')  and when he is safely 'put
      away' they will calmly eat and enjoy the rest of their day as
      it was before the bully came along. I totally admire Robin Marose
      and his beautiful Greek hatchlings.  His group seem normal, whereas,
      mine are not.  Are they 'Born This Way' as Lady GaGa sings?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm totally addicted to our club
      <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">Facebook</A>
      page and love all of you participating with such good advice
      regarding other people's problems.  The outbursts are tremendous
      when touchy subjects come up such as what to do if you catch
      a raccoon that has harmed or killed your turtles or tortoises.
       Be truthful, what would YOU do???  So many people have very
      strong opinions on this subject.  I know what you would WANT
      to do, I know all too well the feelings.  But first you have
      to trap the beast!!  Not so easy, my friends.  I keep saying
      'Aquariums are for Fish'.  Maybe I am wrong?  At least they are
      SAFER in an aquarium!!!!!  And you can sleep at night...............</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There won't be another newsletter
      until January, so take good care of yourselves and enjoy the
      upcoming holiday season and take time to relax all winter and
      plan improvements to your habitats.  Stay in touch through Facebook
      or email me if you are having any difficulties or questions.
       Thanks to all of you for your continued support which keeps
      this club going and going and going.  It is greatly appreciated!!
