       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will be held on<B>
      Saturday, October 20th from 1:30 until 4</B> at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land
      Park Drive. This will be our annual pre-hibernation meeting and
      Father Dimitri will be on hand to check your turtles and tortoises
      over and decide whether or not they should be able to hibernate
      safely. Keep in mind that YOU have the final say on hibernation.
      If your yard floods, then you definitely do not want to allow
      your box turtles to hibernate under those conditions. Every season
      brings its own dangers but I feel hibernation is the most scary.
      If your turtle or tortoise is already asleep, please do not bring
      it to the meeting and do not pass your pet around the room unless
      it is in a container. We'll have plenty of hibernation talk too.
      Feel free to bring a turtle for show and tell. I have another
      'apartment turtle' to show you. Pretty sad.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I know a lot of you bring delicious
      items to each meeting which is greatly appreciated, however,
      the Fall meeting is our 'official' pot-luck gathering so bring
      a dish to share and see if you can come up with more turtle shaped
      foods. Halloween costumed turtles are optional.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After the summer meeting in July,
      Shirley and I found ourselves kneeling on the floor scraping
      up squashed grapes and other food items. We were very tired and
      it was a hot day and we are begging you to please help us clean
      up the room before you leave. A lot of you want to talk to us
      after the meeting and raffle have ended not realizing that the
      room has to be returned to its original condition. So, please
      talk all you want, but while you are doing it, help load up my
      car and clean the floors and help move the tables and chairs
      back where they belong. THANKS!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our 26th <B>TURTLERAMA </B>was
      a huge success. After all of these years you would think the
      excitement would have lessened. Not so! There was a tremendous
      crowd the entire day. I would like to thank Shirley for her untiring
      work at the sale table, Sherri, who helped me with the memberships
      all day, Sharon Jones, Tracy, Joy, Linda, Pepper &amp; Anakin,
      Sylvia &amp; Don, Suzanne and Adrian, Mary, Craig, Lisa, Debbie,
      Michael and Sara, Glenn and Susan, Ron and Lynn, Brenda, Ernestine,
      Chris, Mary and Jennifer and also Mary for helping set up and
      break down the displays and generally clean up afterwards. YOU
      WERE ALL WONDERFUL!!! THANK YOU SO SO SO SO SO SO MUCH!! Special
      thanks to Jennifer who donated 10% of her total from the sale
      of her box turtles, to the Sick Turtle Fund. It is appreciated
      and put to good use At The Bunker!!</FONT></P>

      <B><I>Fall &amp; Hibernation Hints:</I></B> Should hatchlings
      be allowed to hibernate? In the wild they do, but in our yards,
      it is always a dilemma. I personally let the turtles or tortoises
      dictate what they want. Some are robust and eating and show no
      sign of slowing down. These can be kept awake. But if they slow
      down and sleep a lot towards the end of November, by all means,
      let them cool off and sleep for about 8 weeks, from Thanksgiving
      until the beginning of February. This would apply to the hardy
      turtles and tortoises, not the exotics from Africa or South America.
      They must never hibernate. Use your common sense and do not believe
      what you read on the Internet. Keep the tortoises very dry. Do
      NOT put a dish of water in with them. And keep the box turtles
      moist at all times. As long as your yard does not flood, adult
      box turtles can safely hibernate either in their doghouses or
      compost piles. But desert tortoises should not be allowed to
      hibernate outdoors in Sacramento. It's much too damp. In boxes
      of dry clean leaves in the garage is preferred. Some people keep
      them in a cool room in the house. Or in a closet. Good Luck!!</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Dear Felice, Please accept my dues plus
      my annual donation to the Fat Betty Scholarship Fund for Meteorology.
      I enjoy your newsletters so much and I thought I'd update you
      on our Connecticut Bunker! The new outdoor pen was built by me
      during my vacation and the gang has gone wild. At the New York
      Turtle and Tortoise Society show, we took first place for our
      3 Home's Hingebacks and one of them, Lieuzerne, has gotten his
      own degree in Meteorology and can now predict rain. Since his
      mate died tragically from egg-binding, he has become violent
      toward the other two. He holds the female hostage and attacks
      her mate if he approaches. He pushed him right out of their doghouse
      with his shell and then laughed to himself (see photo!) <I>[I'll
      bring it to the meeting - ed]</I> The two Jordanian Spur-thighs
      - Gracie and Dr. Goggles - have engaged in a threesome with Sweet
      Pea the young Leopard tortoise. Dr. Goggles has also engaged
      in some strange tryst ala Woody Allen when he has been mounting
      his adopted daughters (Gracie's young daughters). Just Jim would
      be so proud. On a sad note, Gracie lost her eldest daughter,
      Frankie, to leukemia. I think they're moving on though. The young
      painted turtles have taken to biting their reflections in the
      mirror and the female ran around the bathroom laying little eggs
      - she's only 3 years old!! Much Love, Diane Petrillo</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the Sacramento Bunker:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In August, someone gave
      me two Greek tortoises, but not like my &quot;Just Jims&quot;.
      These are lighter in color and well behaved. But I had a problem.
      I had the three naughty Greeks, Just Jim Junior, Just Jim the
      Jerk and Just Jim the Jackass in the enclosure with the box turtles
      because if they are on the lawn, they chase and bite and mate
      with anything wearing a shell except, of course, females of their
      own species!! I decided to move the bad boys to the side of the
      house and put cement blocks across the front to keep them confined.
      It seemed escape proof. Around 6 the next morning, I awoke hearing
      a lot of muffled banging below the bedroom window. It didn't
      sound like human activity. I hoped I was dreaming. It continued.
      So I got up and got dressed and went out and nobody should ever
      have to see something this disgusting first thing in the morning.
      JJJ (Just Jim Junior - the smallest and meanest of the 3) had
      obviously managed to get out of his new enclosure and traveled
      completely across the back yard and down the other side towards
      the gate. There he found Blondie, the 30 pound leopard tortoise,
      asleep and minding her own business, in her doghouse. He then
      proceeded to relentlessly slam himself into her shell. I guess
      Blondie decided at some point that enough was enough. What I
      saw, never to forget, was JJJ sliding and sloshing around in
      totally black mushy pooh. Blondie must have purposely squirted
      it out like that, perhaps to lessen his blows because he had
      no foothold in the slime!! I wore the face of comedy/drama! I
      picked up JJJ and holding him way out in front of me so I wouldn't
      be hit with flying doo doo, took him to the hose. Blondie and
      her doghouse also got hosed out, so I had quite the busy morning
      before breakfast and had lost my appetite by then!! I might add
      that at 4 AM, the Driveway Patrol went off by my pillow and I
      ran downstairs to see what set it off, preparing to face a raccoon.
      At first I saw nothing. Then I saw Chester, the Elongata, casually
      taking a 4 AM stroll through the yard. Will I ever get a full
      night's sleep?</FONT></P>
