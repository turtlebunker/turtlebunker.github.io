      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      Our 35th Anniversary Spring Meeting will be held on April 23
      at the Robbie Waters Library , 7335 Gloria Drive,  Sac 95831
      beginning at 5 pm. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> The
      group before us will be creating mandalas and I might arrive
      earlier and attend that event.  How about you?  It begins at
      1pm but I don't think I'll be there that early because I don't
      want to be at the library for 8 hours!!  But I love learning
      new crafts!  There will be a <B>chocolate cake</B> at the meeting
      to celebrate the event and the knife will be hidden until it
      is time to cut the cake to prevent the fiasco that happened at
      our 27th Anniversay meeting when someone in the back of the room
      cut open the festive cake box and then cut the cake with their
      own knife and served it to the people sitting near the back of
      the room, DURING THE MEETING, leaving TWO PIECES for the rest
      of the people sitting up front. To this day, no person has ever
      confessed and so the puzzle of who carried a knife into the library
      will go on for a long time and since I didn't hear of anyone
      getting sick, I assume the knife was clean.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the meeting, we will discuss
      coming out of hibernation;  how to build your own incubator and
      also, how to dig up the eggs OR should they just be left in the
      ground???  How do you protect them????  How long do you wait
      before giving up???  Let us hear your suggestions at the meeting.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Fall meeting </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">didn't go as planned because Father Dimitri
      was ill and couldn't attend and do the pre-hibernation checkups,
      so Dr. Torres stepped in to go around the room and check out
      the pets you brought for the event and he did a GREAT job filling
      in.  <B>THANK YOU SO MUCH, Jose!!</B> You do so much for the
      club and it is totally appreciated!!  And we thoroughly enjoy
      seeing your family at the meetings and Turtlerama events as well.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I apologize for not publishing
      a Winter newsletter, but there was absolutely nothing to say!
      At the beginning of January, I felt bad not seeing everyone so
      I decided to have an impromptu gathering of club members at the
      Round Table on Florin and I-5 - they have a very nice meeting
      room, enough seats for 60 people and it is private as well and
      the best thing is that the room is FREE!!  I put the invitation
      on FACEBOOK and about 35 members attended and we had a great
      time chatting, eating pizza and salads (the cost was about $100)
      for all of the pizzas, salads and drinks.  And we did have a
      raffle which was great and we were there from 2 pm until about
      5:30.  We can certainly do this again, have our meetings at the
      pizza parlor, however, we can't bring in any animals, of course.
       Or January will be our pizza meeting from now on.  It really
      was a fun gathering.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Melissa has been stressing water water
      water and I totally agree.  In our very dry climate in Sacramento
      with no rain from February until November (in a normal year)
      the soil and the air become very dry, make sure you have plenty
      of fresh water available for your pets all around the yard. 
      If they are reluctant to drink, just plunk them in shallow water
      often so they don't dehydrate.  Bring out the 'misters' too to
      add humidity to their environment.  <BR>
      Please don't feed hamburger or steak to your pets.  The smell
      will draw the raccoons and other harmful creatures to your yard.
       You've heard me say what goes in comes out the other end and
      if it smells going in, well, it smells worse later on.  Smell
      the turtle pellets too.  If they have a strong fishy odor to
      them, I'd avoid them.  For the same 'in and out' reason.  Don't
      take chances.  <BR>
      Check often for pet hair, human hair, baggie ties, little white
      rocks the tortoises like to eat, plastic bags, needles, pins,
      children's small colorful toys, anything they can climb on and
      tumble upside down over, the list is endless.  I think I told
      you that I impaled my big toe on a pin two years ago in the back
      yard. Dangers are everywhere.  In fact, my neighbor, Monica,
      told me that a hawk has built a nest in the large tree in the
      yard next to mine.  Now I am worried.  Is it the same hawk Jim
      Corbett and I saw one day when he was visiting, the one who swooped
      down to pick up a fake cat I had sitting on top of an enclosure?
       The hawk must have realized it was not real and zoomed back
      up into the tree...... Can someone tell me if the Bunker is in
      danger?????</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Unlike the last two years, Spring
      did not spring early enough.  We were treated to drought ending
      torrential rainfalls and cold weather until the end of March.
       I did have some losses which were heartbreaking.  The winter
      seemed to last longer and was colder than I ever remember.  The
      East coast was getting the warmer weather and after last winter's
      record snowfall, I was happy for them.  They needed a break!
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The long cold wet winter did
      affect many of our pets and I've been dealing with a lot of calls
      regarding sick pets with swollen eyes, lethargy, not out of hibernation
      yet, etc..  I do believe a string of warm days will go a long
      way towards returning them to good health.  If not, let me know.
       Or we can discuss it on our Facebook page.  We have a good network
      of people with great ideas and advice there.  Thank you all so
      much for your help.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bunker residents, who don't
      hibernate, had a peaceful winter lying on their heat mat inside
      of the greenhouse. Others who refused to hibernate landed in
      there too.  Zappo the Wacko slept 'somewhere' in the yard and
      came out in early March to search for my feet.  I placed him
      into the greenhouse at this time because being chased, having
      my feet mounted and bitten over and over again is very annoying
      when I am trying to work in the yard or am just standing there
      minding my own business.  WHACK.  Plus, the Bunker has many visitors
      who don't appreciate being assaulted either.  He just appears
      out of nowhere, running at people's feet at top speed!    The
      Bunker is a magnet for weird tortoises!   If I dangle a tomato
      in front of his face, he will bite at it with frightening force.
       I sometimes wonder if he is more hungry than anything else???</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Also, putting him up on a table
      in the yard will prevent him from hurting anyone.  Most tortoises
      have depth perception and will not go off the edge of a table
      and fall to the ground.  (I'm sure there are some exceptions!!)
      But I have never seen one fall unless it slid off.  So there
      he is walking round and round the table not daring to fall off
      and harm himself, but he has no trouble harming people.  I became
      a victim 5 days before our Turtlerama last August.  I was quietly
      watering some plants on a lovely sunny warm day and suddenly
      I saw him coming at me at full speed.  I stepped back and immediately
      fell over something and ended up on my back with the hose nozzle
      pointed straight up in the air as well as my feet and the water
      was raining down on my face.  I turned my head to see him heading
       straight for me, head bouncing as he approached and I got up
      as fast as I could because I didn't want to find out what he
      would have done to me had I stayed on the ground.  I was bruised
      and soaked but I was standing up, safe (except for my feet) but
      the most curious thing was the fact that I had the running hose
      in one hand and in the other, a cactus in a pot!  I guess I must
      have grabbed it on my way down?  It was miraculously unharmed!!
       I still have a bump on my leg tho....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I didn't tell anyone of my ordeal
      because Melissa had broken her foot at the time and I didn't
      want to take her place as the newly injured in the club....but
      her injury was not tortoise related, or was it???  </FONT></P>
