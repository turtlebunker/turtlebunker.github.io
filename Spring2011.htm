       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Our Spring meeting will be held on
      <B>Saturday, April 16th</B> at the Belle Cooledge Library,  5600
      South Land Park Drive, 95822  from 1:30 until 4 pm.  This will
      be our <B>30th</B> anniversary meeting and any thoughts about
      the club; past, present, and future will be greatly appreciated.
       We have outlasted Oprah, Regis and the Space Shuttle program.
        We've done a lot of good for the turtles and tortoises, unfortunately,
      our work is not done and is somewhat more of a challenge due
      to the mis-information out there on the 'Internet'.  And it's
      always the turtles and tortoises who have to suffer because of
      it.  So let's keep educating as many people as possible, ok?
       It's now 2011.  Believe us when we say:  AQUARIUMS ARE FOR FISH!!!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Before I continue, I am convinced
      that there is a serial food thief at our meetings.  At our crowded
      Winter meeting, (which took place on a 70 degree day in January),
      I had four pizzas brought in via Round Table.  One was my favorite,
      Chicken and Garlic, and I noticed a lot of you choosing that
      one over the cheese and pepperoni varieties.  I took ONE little
      piece and began to eat it but since everyone was talking to me,
      I decided to put it aside so I could eat it later or definitely
      on the way home.  I 'hid' it on the kitchen windowsill with my
      other belongings behind the table in the front of the room. 
      The meeting ended around 4 and even tho we still had an hour
      to stay in the room,  I noticed all of the 'stuff' being carried
      out and placed into my station wagon as I spoke with some members
      outside.  When I finally had a moment to eat the pizza,  it was
      nowhere to be found.  I searched throughout the meeting room
      and then I searched my car, looking through everything.  NO PIZZA!!
       Did someone eat it?  Did someone throw it away???  I was hungry
      and furious!!!  Whoever you are and you have to know who you
      are, all I can say is:  <B>YOU OWE ME ONE!!!</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now that I got that out of my
      system, back to turtle talk.  As usual, a lot of sliders are
      coming in for adoption and I'll bring some to the meeting so
      please consider taking a few for your pond.   If you filled out
      an adoption form, it's always wise to check back with me frequently.
       Sliders and Russians are usually available, others, not so much.

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We will be having our Turtlerama on July
      16th instead of a meeting.  The library staff has scheduled adult
      reading programs for every Saturday in August so I thought it
      would be better to have the show instead of our summer meeting.
       Of course, we can have an abbreviated meeting that day as well
      but I don't see how we can have our raffle.  Any ideas?  </FONT></I></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Dept. of Fish and Game commissioners
      FINALLY did the right thing by deciding not to issue any more
      permits to the Oriental markets to sell turtles and frogs for
      food, only to overturn their own decision soon after when someone
      proclaimed that it was their culture to eat turtles.  This means
      that more and more turtles will be taken from the wild in Alabama,
      Louisiana, etc. and many will be released in our waterways joining
      the thousands out there multiplying every day.  Is it better
      to be hacked to death (bringing good luck to someone) or swim
      freely in Folsom Lake?  This decision seals the fate of our native
      California pond turtles and the red-eared slider will be listed
      as our State Reptile.                </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As the warm weather approaches,
      try to stay one step ahead of your pets.  Clean up the yard,
      especially small white rocks and pebbles that tortoises seem
      to enjoy eating;  look for bits of plastic lying about, animal
      and human hair/fur,  pins and needles (I stepped on one barefoot
      in my own yard last summer and was ashamed of myself).  Don't
      leave your dogs alone with your turtles or tortoises.  Always
      better to be safe than sorry.  If you can, install an alarm to
      warn you of raccoons in the night.  BE ALERT!!  Give your pets
      a calm quiet environment.  I was recently asked by a teacher
      for a desert tortoise for her classroom.  Can you imagine anything
      more cruel than to have a tortoise in an aquarium in a busy classroom.
       That's what sent Brutus, the African Hingeback,  over the edge.
       He is fine, by the way, living a leisurely life with a kind
      family who are giving him the best life possible.  Thanks Kari
      for taking him in.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was an uneventful winter.
       We didn't have much ice in Sacramento as we did last winter,
      therefore, most of the Russians, all of the Greeks and a few
      Hermann's decided not to hibernate at all.  On any sunny day
      or any day it was 50 degrees, they would come out to bask and
      since they were going back into their shelters around 3 pm, I
      was not worried.  Everyone looked great.  Most of the box turtles
      did hibernate including the naughty 'Obama' who is a Gulf Coast
      box turtle whom I found submerged head down in the Reeves turtle
      pond last winter.  He was unharmed and since he never did that
      again, perhaps he had some memory of the event?   He has moved
      himself into the Reeves and Wood turtle enclosure but I do expect
      him to move out once the weather warms up for  good.   Gulf Coasts
      Francois, Joyce and Oliver decided to climb out of the enclosure
      and hibernate near the fence in the NW area of the Bunker.  Of
      course, I had no idea until they emerged a few weeks ago along
      with Suzi and an unidentified Russian female.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Greenhouse residents are
      anxious to get out but I hesitate to let them out until all danger
      of cold nights are over.  50 degrees is what you want to watch
      for.  When the nights don't go below 50, it's safe to leave your
      tropical tortoises out all night, but make sure they are in a
      shelter.  Some of them seem to sit and sleep wherever they might
      be as darkness approaches.    </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Newlyweds Jim and Suzi are awake
       and ready to enjoy a long hot summer.  Last summer was way too
      chilly.  Their quintupets have been indoors all winter and are
      doing well, growing bigger and stronger.  They eat romaine lettuce,
      thawed out peas and corn,  grass and clover and dandelions from
      outdoors and an occasional monkey biscuit. They have a little
      soak about once every 10 days but don't like that too much and
      scramble to get out. Blondie, the leopard, did not lay any eggs
      last summer so I didn't have a pile of hatchlings to take care
      of which made my life easier this time.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Speaking of peas and corn, if
      you feed these items to your pets, please clean up the leftovers
      before they dry up because they become as hard as rocks and could
      be eaten by mistake and be harmful.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Diane Petrillo from the Connecticut
      Bunker recently asked if Fat Betty had any weather predictions.
       Fat Betty, our club meteorologist, won't reveal her secret formula
      for weather forecasting, but is warning everyone not to plant
      their tomatoes too early because because we are in for another
      cool spring.  Summer, however, will be above normal across the
      USA and very muggy in the Connecticut area.<BR>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">News from Michael's Bunker
      in Turlock:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  4 box turtles
      hatched last September.  One was a runt.  He started feeding
      them worms, snails and slugs.  The runt ate the most.  Eating
      eating eating all of the time, so much so that he is now the
      biggest!  Recently Michael switched over to soaked Pedigree dog
      food.  Well, three are eating it but not the runt named Button.
       He walks around watching the others eat but turns up his nose
      at the dog food.   Then he sits next to the glass watching Michael
      and his wife and stares at them as if to say, &quot;Hey, where
      are my worms?&quot;  He also knows that the worms hide under
      the water dish and keeps pawing the edges to find them and once
      in awhile he scores.  Michael thinks Button has a higher IQ than
      the others.  What do you think?  I agree.  Some are smarter.
       His shell is normal which indicates that he is not over-eating.</FONT></P>

      participate in the Kids On The Water event at Miller Park Marina
      on June 3 from 10 until 2.  We could give a presentation on turtles
      for 40 minutes to one hour and we could do this several times
      if anyone is interested.  Of course you could bring a few live
      turtles to show and tell the kids about.  Let Me Know so I can
      tell Kendra.  There are plenty of sliders down at the marina
      alongside the native Pond turtles.<BR>
