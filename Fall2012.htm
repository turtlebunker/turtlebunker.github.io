      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, October 20th from 1:30 until 4 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library,  5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822</B>.
       Once again, Father Dimitri plans on being at the meeting to
      conduct the pre-hibernation checkups.  Please have your pet in
      a box or carrier and don't pass it around the room.  If your
      turtle or tortoise is already asleep, please do not bring it
      to the meeting.  If your pet is showing signs of disease, it
      is best to leave it at home but let us know what the symptoms
      are.  We know how stressful this time of the year can be and
      the warm September we are experiencing is only delaying the inevitable
      cold weather ahead.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting is also a fun
      meeting (aren't they all?) so bring a dish for our pot-luck table;
      chips, dips; cookies/cakes are always welcome.  And remember,
      Munch and Mingle at 3 and, um, it's ok to dress up your turtle
      for Halloween for a prize.  We all need to laugh now and then...
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We will have a lot of potted
      plants available and there will be hatchlings of various species
      for adoption or sale.  Please proceed carefully because it can
      be a little tricky keeping the little guys awake, alive and healthy
      during the winter months ahead.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The TURTLERAMA was a tremendous
       success with a huge turnout.  I think half the city came to
      see the turtles and displays on a wonderful day.  Thanks to all
      of you for going way over the top with your lovely setups and
      patience answering so many questions from the public.  Special
      thanks to Maria Lambert, once again, for compiling the list below
      and also for mopping up the meeting room floor afterwards*. 
       Maria, your efforts are greatly appreciated. And many many thanks
      to:<BR>

      <B>Fall Hints:  </B>The winter weather will be here soon so it
      is time to decide who will hibernate and who will not.  If you
      are in doubt, call a club member and not some person claiming
      to be an expert 'on the Internet' or worse, Craigslist!!  A person
      in Florida cannot possibly help you with your hibernation questions
      out here in northern California.  If you contact me, I can immediately
      put you in touch with someone who is qualified to give you correct
      information.   It is best if your hardy turtle or tortoise is
      allowed to hibernate, however, sometimes it is not possible,
      so try to keep them warm and eating all winter altho they will
      sleep more and eat less.  They will be ok.  Winter doesn't last
      that long here.  Slowing down is perfectly normal.  And remember:
       NEVER LET A SICK TURTLE OR TORTOISE HIBERNATE AND NEVER LET
      A HIBERNATING TORTOISE GET WET.  </FONT></P>

      tortoises not be allowed on the floor in the meeting room.  In

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This summer is 200% better than
      last.  I was not outside every night shooting my pellet gun and
      throwing rocks at the vicious raccoon and losing many nights
      of sleep.  We do what we have to do.  The only incident I had
      was 6 days before the Turtlerama, I accidentally whacked my right
      foot with a 24 inch wavy top edging brick.  Boy, did that hurt
      and swell up.  I rested, iced, compressed and elevated (RICE)
      for the next two days but by Wednesday, I had to get the Turtlerama
      displays out from every corner of the garage and storage areas
      and cleaned up.  The day before the show, I loaded up and then
      unloaded two cars full of 'stuff' at the library.  Ouch!  And
      more on Turtlerama day!  And then afterwards, loaded it back
      into the cars again.  For the next two weeks, I did my best to
      rest the foot and didn't put the stuff away until the end of
      August.  It's much better now.  At least I am not limping anymore!
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile, the Greeks and Hermann's
      tortoises continue to aggravate and entertain.  Having to sit
      more, I did more turtle watching than normal and several things
      became quite clear.  The Hermann's tortoises have only one goal
      in life - to make babies.  In so doing, they constantly seek
      out the females and are relentless in their pursuit.  The females
      don't seem to mind because I noticed that altho they try to run
      away, they do so at a snail's pace!  The Greeks, on the other
      hand, also seem to want to add to their population but they go
      about it in a different and not a very productive way.  They
      spend their days chasing any male tortoise of any species, the
      bigger the better.  I can hear the 'hammering' as I sit here
      typing the newsletter.  Excuse me for a moment while I go outside
      to put Just Jim Jr. back into solitary confinement!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Re: sliders, I finally came to
      my senses.  I now try to send them to their new homes with large
      safe ponds without having them come to my house first for 'evaluation'.
       It all became clear in June when I had 15 big sliders to adopt
      out which compromised my own few turtles in the small pond. 
      So life At The Bunker is more stable at this moment in time.
       The turtles and tortoises who were severely injured by the raccoon
      last year have healed pretty well and manage to get around. 
      I never let my guard down and have come up with more ideas I'll
      share with you at the meeting and I hope you might have some
      new ideas of your own on how to prevent these killers from visiting
      our yards.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm happy to report a baby Hermann
      has hatched.  He is really cute, so perfect, spoiled, and I'm
      hoping for more hatchlings next summer.  As for Greek hatchlings,
      forget it!  And I hope the people who do have babies, share their
      secrets of success with me.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our meeting after this one won't
      be until January 26th, so I will take this opportunity to wish
      you all a very happy Holiday Season and a wonderful 2013 to one
      and all and thank you so much for all of your support this past
      year.  I couldn't do it without you.  Our new Facebook friends
      have made the club even more lively and fun!!  Welcome Aboard!!</FONT></P>
