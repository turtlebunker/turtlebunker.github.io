      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, July 16th</B> at the <B>Belle Cooledge Library</B>
      (corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land Park Drive) from 1:30
      until 4. The meeting will be followed in four weeks by the <B>TURTLERAMA</B>
      (see flyer below) and, with your help, I&#146;d like to make
      the Turtlerama bigger and better and more interesting than ever
      before. You have to admit that a lot of our displays are over
      20 years old and we are in need of more up-to-date displays.
      Let&#146;s put our heads together at the meeting and make some
      changes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Bring your ideas and we&#146;ll
      go over each and every suggestion. And please sign up for the
      Turtlerama. Let me know if you can exhibit, what you will exhibit
      or if you can help that day.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Donations have slowed down for
      our raffle so please look through your stash of turtle items
      and see if you have doubles or are tired of some items. We&#146;ll
      try to have box turtle eggs on the raffle table - if the weather
      settles down and they get into the egg laying mood! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many thanks to Michael Rajkumar
      for his wonderful presentation at the last meeting. I believe
      Michael was touching upon some new information that has come
      out regarding pyramiding in hatchling tortoises. We all have
      different opinions on this phenomenon, mine being that they simply
      eat too much under our tender loving care. A study done in Vienna
      showed that it wasn&#146;t excess protein, excess calcium or
      excess anything that causes the shell lumps and pyramids. It
      was the lack of humidity! The higher the humidity, the smoother
      the shell. Their theory is that the hatchlings spend their first
      few years of life hiding in damp grass - which is probably true.
      They even recommend 100% humidity be available to African tortoise
      hatchlings at all times. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I&#146;m going to try it with
      my Leopard hatchlings. They are not pyramided, but then, they
      are not smooth either. There is so much to learn........<B>SEE
      YOU AT THE MEETING!! </B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Use a &#145;mister&#146; in your
      box turtle enclosure on hot dry summer days. Your water turtles
      will also enjoy the moisture. You want to keep the Sulcatas,
      Leopards, Russian and Desert tortoises in a dry environment but
      always have clean bowls of water available but not in full sun
      for obvious reasons. If they won&#146;t drink, lay a hose on
      the lawn and let the water run for awhile and they may prefer
      to drink that way. It&#146;s ok if they decide to go under the
      sprinklers too, as long as they are dry before retiring for the
      night. Put some chairs on the lawn so the tortoises don&#146;t
      have to go far to find shelter. I mow at sundown when I am sure
      everyone is in their shelter, but I patrol first, of course.
      You can never be too careful. Always be alert for predators.
      They are everywhere.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Red eared sliders, red eared
      sliders, red eared sliders, there does not seem to be an end
      to the deluge of homeless sliders. I am afraid to answer the
      phone and when I do, 90% of the time it is a person needing a
      home for their one to five sliders because they either want to
      travel, the kids grew up, they are tired of taking care of them,
      they are too big, they are sick, or a raccoon or possum has done
      some damage. Finding homes for all of them can be challenging.
      Keeping them clean until a home is found is even more challenging
      because as soon as you clean the water, they mess it up again.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After a very long cold springtime,
      warmer weather finally arrived (sort of) at the end of May. I
      felt terrible keeping Blondie and the other Leopard tortoises
      in the greenhouse for 8 months but it was much too cold at night
      to let them out during the day and besides, I never would have
      been able to find them at night to put them back in. Once out,
      they sprung into action, eating the grass they love and enjoying
      real sunshine and refreshing breezes in their faces. There are
      a few small Sulcatas here available for adoption, but please
      don&#146;t ask unless you are prepared to take care of something
      that will grow quickly to 100 to 200 pounds and excretes like
      a camel. And the Sulcatas can&#146;t get chilled and do not hibernate.
      They need lots of room for grazing in a safe and secure environment.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I continue to be amazed by the
      color of the Leopard tortoise who hatched in the greenhouse last
      October. While his &#145;littermates&quot;, who hatched in the
      incubator in the bedroom, are the usual pretty black and white,
      he has retained the sandy color and is easily identifiable when
      you see them all together. His shell is plain with no markings
      at all. I thought he would have changed by now. Mother Nature
      knows better. It&#146;ll be interesting to see what happens in
      the future.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I had invited guests for a family
      BBQ over the Memorial Day weekend. I cleaned and cleaned outside,
      trying to make the yard pleasant. Each time I spruced up the
      patio by the kitchen door, one or more of the tortoises would
      walk by, lift up the rear end and squirt out something vile.
      I must have mopped the patio a dozen times the day of the cookout.
      It was planned for later in the day and I was hoping that the
      tortoises would be in their shelters by the time my guests arrived.
      The tortoises did go into their doghouses, however, when they
      saw the activity and smelled the food cooking, they had to come
      out and investigate. Joltin&#146; Joe, the Marginata, followed
      by four Greeks, Tillie the male Leopard and Fernando, a formerly
      very shy Leopard tortoise meandered onto the patio with their
      heads held high looking for a handout. I gave my guests bananas
      to feed them and while I was in the kitchen preparing our dinner,
      my guests groans and gasps indicated to me that what was going
      in one end was coming out the other - BIG TIME! It very well
      could have been my last BBQ. </FONT></P>
