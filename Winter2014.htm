       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our next meeting will be held on <B>Saturday,
      January 17th</B> at the Robbie Waters Library (7335 Gloria Drive,
      95831) beginning at 4 pm until whenever we are done enjoying
      being together!!  I'd like to have a presentation on weeds, the
      good and the bad.  I personally don't have much expertise about
      weeds but I have noticed that in my yard, the good weeds are
      readily eaten and anything that might be poisonous is ignored.
       I do know that torts like 'sweet' tasting foods (don't we all?)
      and perhaps the troublesome weeds are bitter?  Sometimes mushrooms
      pop up but nobody touches them so I assume these are the bad
      ones and I get rid of them.   Feel free to add your 2 cents and
      bring some samples if they weren't destroyed by our recent freezing
      temperatures.   Also, try to bring a turtle shaped food item
      (cake, cookies, jello?) to the meeting for all to share and enjoy.
       (I won't bring the inedible potatoes again).  The club will
      supply the Pepsi (tell me what else you like and I'll get it).
       A turtle or tortoise for show and tell is always welcome at
      the meetings if any are awake....  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B>SPRING MEETING</B> will
      be held on <B>May 2nd </B>this year due to the fact that the
      library had all of Saturday's dates in April fully booked.  And
      it will begin at 4 pm and last until you get tired.  We have
      the room for several hours.    By the way, our Fall meeting was
      great at the new library.  Father Dimitri did a fabulous job
      examining one turtle and tortoise after another, making sure
      it was healthy enough to hibernate. <B> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
      YOUR TIRELESS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CLUB AND OUR MEMBERS AND THEIR
      PETS!! </B>The meeting room is much easier to set up which will
      be excellent news for those of you who broke your backs dragging
      and lifting those tons of chairs at Belle Cooledge not to mention
      the heavy tables - everything is already set up and there is
      a lovely kitchen area in the back of the room for snacks and
      drinks.  The room has a good 'feel' to it.   Everyone was very
      relaxed and had a great time and thanks to all for the wonderful
      food you provided for our 'pot luck' and feel free to bring food
      to each meeting since they occur later in the day.<BR>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> All was fine until the big freeze hit
      and the tortoises who refused to go into hibernation ended up
      being placed into the greenhouse for their own good.  Sitting
      out AT NIGHT with ice on their backs is definitely not a good
      thing!!  They are back outside now and acting normally.  These
      were a Hermann and two Marginatas and a few box turtles as well,
      including Loekie who is quite well after health problems for
      two years.  I couldn't take a chance on letting her roam around
      in the very cold temperatures.  Darwin, the terribly deformed
      leopard tortoise was seen doing her dead act in the greenhouse
      again, sitting there motionless and stiff and partially off of
      the Stanfield heat mat, I do believe she knows I will bring her
      indoors to live the life of luxury (altho she is rather smelly
      at times) ......The three newly hatched Asian or Chinese box
      turtles (Fong, Fong and Fong) are living a wonderful life in
      the upstairs bathroom in either one container or the other as
      I switch them back and forth every morning, a worthwhile activity
      for me to watch them looking so healthy and growing.   I don't
      have successful hatchlings that often as everyone knows.   So
      this is a real treat!  The few Greeks and Hermann's who are refusing
      to hibernate seem fine outside, I just make sure they have gone
      back to 'bed' when the sun goes down.   I'm following my own
      advice,<B><I> &quot;Let Them Be Turtles&quot;</I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am so hoping that we
      have a nice warm January like we had last year.  And I do hope
      all of your turtles and tortoises come out of hibernation healthy
      and happy and ready for another season of life and love.<BR>

      Thank you all so much for your deluge of wonderful birthday cards
      and Christmas cards.   They were so much fun to receive.  And
      now it is 2015.  We had a lot of UGLY things to deal with in
      2014 regarding the Belle Cooledge Library staff so let us hope
      that 2015 will be a wonderful stress free year.  I think it will
      be our best year ever and YOU all make it happen.  Thanks so
      much for your neverending support, it is greatly appreciated!
       Wishing you all a very healthy and prosperous 2015!!</FONT></P>
