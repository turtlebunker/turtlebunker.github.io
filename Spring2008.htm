       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> - Our Spring meeting will be held on
      <B>Saturday, April 19th</B>, at the Belle Cooledge Library located
      on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge Road from 1:30
      until 4 pm.  It will be our 27th anniversary.  I never dreamed
      it would last this long and be stronger than ever.  Thanks for
      putting up with my 'dictatorship' throughout the years.  The
      only complaint I hear is from people who want me to raise the
      dues.  Since &frac34; of the membership sends a generous dues
      'plus', there is no need to raise the dues.  Even those with
      only a few dollars to spend can 'belong' to the club and I can
      continue to enjoy receiving envelopes with two dollars in change
      from the little ones.   Thank you all for your continuing support!
       You are the ones who keep the club alive and kicking!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As long as we are on the subject
      of dues, I always try to send a thank-you note to all who send
      $10 or more.  As the USPS continues to increase their price of
      stamps, the situation is becoming ridiculous.  If it is ok with
      you, please share your email address with me and I will send
      my thanks via that route and preserve a good chunk of the dues
      plus each year.  It only makes sense!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our winter meeting was held on
      a surprisingly sunny and mild day on January 19th.  The meeting
      was well attended and even tho it wasn't a 'pot luck' meeting,
      many of you brought delicious salads and baked goods.  Thanks
      so much and also for helping clean up.  We had a wonderful raffle
      as well and thanks for all of your raffle donations.  It's the
      highlight of each meeting.  On that sunny day, who knew we would
      never see the sun again for over a month?  Who knew that we would
      have to endure very un-Sacramento-like weather of 30 degree nights
      and not much warmer by day.  Boy OH Boy, everyone had to listen
      to my whining about 'where's this global warming' and try to
      explain it to me.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But Spring is on its way now
      and we have to pay attention to what is happening with our turtles
      and tortoises.  I don't have a speaker scheduled for the meeting
      and I hope some of you will bring your pets for Show and Tell.
       We'll also munch and mingle with lots of turtle talk and have
      a good raffle.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Spring Hints:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I certainly hope your turtles and tortoises
      came through the tough winter in good shape.  Check them over
      as they come out of hibernation.  By the time you receive this
      newsletter,  most should be awake altho some desert tortoises
      do not awaken until May.  Check everyone over as they come out
      of hibernation.  Look for swollen eyes, swelling anywhere, oozing
      from any opening, lethargy and not eating.  Most wake up just
      fine without any weight loss, but others need a boost sometimes.
       A warm soak helps and you should physically move your tortoise
      into the sunshine each day or close to it so he can choose what
      he wants to do.  Don't leave him alone in the full sun until
      you know he is wide awake again.   Some are totally awake right
      away but others may take weeks to resume their normal activities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As a lot of you know, many of
      our pets do not survive the hibernation period.  It is nobody's
      fault so don't kick yourself around too much.  If you feel guilty
      because you didn't consult a vet, the truth is that by the time
      you see anything is wrong, it is usually too late to do anything
      about it.  Often, they wake up and die soon after because they
      have no reserves left to survive.  All you can do is try your
      best to keep them healthy and safe, this means cleaning up the
      yard, making it escape proof and getting rid of tiny rocks they
      love to eat, hair, pet fur, baggie ties, paper clips, plastic
      bags and other debris that has blown in or brought in on your
      shoes.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's a constant battle, I know.
       The predators are everywhere.  Rats are becoming more and more
      of a menace, especially in the 'north' area of Sacramento.  The
      'Norway' rats seem to be abundant there, but down in my 'south'
      area, I've only seen 'roof' rats.  They don't bother the turtles
      or tortoises but love to eat leftover food, especially corn on
      the cob.  Be ALERT at all times.  Even if you've never seen a
      predator.  They are there.  You've just been lucky.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was quite a long winter at
      the Bunker.  On the twin bed in the upstairs bedroom were containers
      of desert tortoise hatchlings, young leopard tortoises, a pair
      of South American wood turtles I really like, a Greek tortoise
      who was found at a construction site in December and a Russian
      tortoise.  Downstairs in the living room were tubs of red eared
      sliders.  I try so hard to tell people there is no room at the
      Inn during the winter months but everyone has their sad story
      to tell as to why they have to give up their pet.  Keeping them
      downstairs helps because it is colder than upstairs and they
      get kind of quiet, the poor little guys.  The smaller luckier
      ones are up on a ledge by a sunny window.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Outside, two Greek tortoises
      refused to sleep no matter how bad the weather was.  Ice, driving
      rain and wind didn't bother them at all.  Each day, without fail,
      they would come out of their nice snug doghouse and sit and sit
      and sit.  And each night, without fail, I would go out and pick
      up their wet cold bodies and dry them off and put them back into
      their doghouse.  They are doing well at this time.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Last August, September and October,
      Blondie, the leopard tortoise, laid clutches of eggs, 10 or 11
      at a time.  When I see her scraping the ground with her back
      legs, I put her into the greenhouse so I have some idea of where
      the eggs are because once they lay eggs in the yard, they cover
      the nest so perfectly, you'll never find them.  I was incubating
      eggs for other people so I had to set up another incubator (the
      drawer I used last year was not available at the time).  I put
      the October eggs into the second incubator.  In January, the
      August eggs began to hatch.  But they seemed weak, some died
      soon after hatching and some, sadly, never quite made it out
      of the egg.  This also happened to a clutch belonging to someone
      else who has a female leopard tortoise and Tarzan Jr. is the
      father.  Only 3 of mine survived from the August clutch.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  At the end of February, right
      on time, the September 29th clutch began to hatch and these are
           beautiful, large and lighter in color like their mom.  As
      they were hatching, I peeked into the other incubator and to
      my complete surprise,  most of the October 29th eggs were hatching
      a month early!  I ended up with two deceased in their eggs but
      9 were alive and kicking.  I am assuming that the second incubator,
      being smaller, was warmer than the main incubator, causing the
      eggs to hatch earlier than expected.  Depending on how robust
      they are, I'll probably have some to sell at the spring meeting.
       I guess you can say it was a very EGGCITING February at the
      Bunker!!  The twin bed is overcrowded at the moment with the
      additional containers of hatchlings.  I use an electric throw
      blanket set on low to keep everyone warm and sometimes I lounge
      with them along with the cat.  It's fun to watch them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The occupants of the Greenhouse,
      Blondie and her friends and Chester the Elongata and several
      male Russian tortoise guests had a quiet uneventful winter. 
       Only Darwin, the deformed leopard tortoise, would not stay on
      the Stanfield Heat Mat.  So every night I had to go out and crawl
      on my hands and knees to pull her out of the cold area and put
      her onto the mat.  Now that it is warmer, she's on the mat every
      night.   About a week ago, I spotted a Russian tortoise basking
      by the pond with the sliders.  He had dug himself out of the
      greenhouse.  If you remember, a desert tortoise did the same
      thing a few years ago.  It's hard to keep up with these guys!!
       If anyone mentions the word 'vacation' to me, you'll see my
      eyes glaze over altho there could be a room waiting for me at
      the Funny Farm.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You'll be happy to know that
      Fat Betty has come out of hibernation as well as all of the Greek
      Just Jim's.  I don't know what to name the new one from the construction
      site as his personality has not made itself known yet.  He seems
      to be quite nice so far.  I'm sure it won't last long.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I do hope all of your turtles
      and tortoises survived the winter and are doing well at this
      time.  </FONT></P>
