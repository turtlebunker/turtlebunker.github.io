      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, July 21</B> from 1:30 until 4 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library, 5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822.  There
      will be plenty to talk about including the upcoming<B> TURTLERAMA</B>
      on <B>August 18th</B>.  We had about 1,000 visitors last year
      and it could top that this year due to the exposure on the Internet.
         PLEASE let me know if you are able to exhibit or help that
      day by phoning, emailing or signing up at the meeting and even
      notifying me on Facebook will be fine.  I'll take care of all
      of the promotional material.  The folks at Good Day Sacramento
      may be able to show some of it since they are now on from 7-11
      am on weekends. We need as many turtles and tortoises as possible
      and more than one display of the same species is fine since there
      is such a huge crowd.  We also need people to relieve the exhibitors
      now and then and also to keep things cleaned up.  It's our only
      chance each year to reach out to the public and show them the
      right way to keep turtles and tortoises and dispel all of the
      nonsense they read 'on the Internet'.  We can't give up the fight!!
       Thank you all for hanging in there with me. <B><I> IT'S GOING
      TO BE GREAT!</I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had a great turnout
      for our spring meeting, about 80 good turtle people were counted.
       (Some not so good left crumbs all over the floor).....thanks
      for those who help set up and break down the tables and chairs.
       I know it's a pain......we had great turtle talk and a fabulous
      raffle.</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm sure the weather for our
      July 21st meeting will be hot and sunny so let's make it a <B>LUAU
      </B>themed event.  Dress in bright colors.  The club will supply
      the leis and cool drinks and snacks.  Bring one or more of your
      turtles and/or tortoises for a good show and tell.  This is the
      best time of the year.  Our pets are at their healthiest.  The
      runny noses are gone.  So are the swollen eyelids.  The lethargy.
       We'll discuss the incubation of eggs more thoroughly.  I know
      what works for me, let's hear what works for you.  We'll try
      to have some eggs on the raffle table too.  Some of you have
      shown me the box turtles you hatched from those eggs years ago
      and they are so big and healthy.  Which brings to mind, if you
      have any turtle items you'd like to donate to our sale or raffle,
      it will be appreciated.  Club member Elaine from Hawaii just
      sent me a box full of beautiful items.  You won't believe your
      eyes!! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I love summertime.  Our pets
      are so happy and active.  Even though you are very busy keeping
      up with them and cleaning up after them, try to take the time
      to sit and observe and enjoy their antics.  And while you are
      watching them, be alert for any bumps on the neck or elsewhere
      or anything that doesn't look 'quite right'.  It's always better
      to catch things immediately.  Is anyone limping?  They get into
      all sorts of trouble fighting and climbing where they shouldn't
      be going in the first place.  Bermuda grass is dangerous when
      the long strings develop.  Since turtles and tortoises don't
      seem to know how to go in reverse, they just plunge ahead even
      if a string of bermuda is wrapped around their limbs or even
      their head and neck.  They can strangle themselves.  Also, sometimes
      male box turtles fight and injure one another in their neck area,
      however, you can't really see any damage unless the turtle sticks
      his head out which they rarely do with an injury.  And these
      sores can be invaded by those darned maggots, so always try to
      check the box turtles carefully, especially when you see fighting
      and aggressive mating going on.  There's much more to cover but
      I'm running out of room.  We can continue at the meeting!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Same old stuff going on here:
       The Greek male tortoises relentlessly chasing the females and
      even other males and squeaking loudly as they stand up behind
      them with their mouths wide open.  It is pathetic and comical
      because they are usually not standing up behind their mates,
      but any tortoise who happens to be passing by.  The victims usually
      stand still waiting for the encounter to be over so they can
      get a bite to eat or find a cozy shelter in which to take an
      afternoon nap.   I call these &quot;rude interruptions&quot;.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The deluge of red eared sliders
      continues but there are very generous people who have given them
      new homes in large ponds on their private property.   It amazes
      me how long people keep them in aquariums and deal with the mess
      and smell.  It's bad enough when they are outside in the kiddie
      wading pools which turn totally green in the hot sun very quickly.
       And then the uneaten food clouds the water as well.  Let's face
      it, water turtles are not easy to care for, indoors or out. 
      It seems a bit cruel to keep a wild animal in a glass prison
      just for one's amusement.  How many of you 'used' to have one
      in an aquarium and it died?  Yes, my hand is raised.  And I had
      more than one!!  I hope I am making up for my ignorance now.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A lot of Russian tortoises have
      come in for adoption.  I think people buy them but don't realize
      what escape artists they can be, digging and climbing are their
      specialties!  If they can see to the other side of the yard,
      they will go to great lengths to get out.  And this pretty much
      applies to most turtles and tortoises.  The grass is always greener
      on the other side!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I've been turtle sitting one
      of our club member's pets for several weeks and it certainly
      is a learning experience.  There are 4 beautiful spotted turtles,
      two males and two females, and they seem quite content here although,
      every night I carry them to the safety of my screened in patio
      for safekeeping in case we get a night 'visitor'.  So far so
      good.  There are also 3 baby marginated tortoises, very sweet
      and pretty and eating well, also on the screened patio at night.
       But the 5 South American wood turtles are in the greenhouse
      in their huge bin which is filled with dirt and a water dish.
       They seem to like the heat in there and believe me, it is extra
      hot at this writing due to the heat wave (105 right now).   I
      keep checking on them and they seem to stay under the dirt most
      of the time, only coming out to eat if nobody is around.  I respect
      their privacy and I'm happy that they are in the greenhouse so
      that I don't have to carry them in and out twice a day.  My nighttime
      ritual is very tiring.  But  everyone has to be in their shelters
      overnight and I've also made the doorways to the doghouses smaller
      so only the turtles fit through.  Your ideas are always welcome.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding predators, everyone
      must always be on the alert.  And don't give your turtles meat.
       I think meat (especially hamburger meat)  attracts them because
      what goes in, comes out, if you know what I mean.  I use ZuPreem's
      Monkey Biscuits (Primate Diet #6985)  and that has kept everyone
      healthy for many many years.  I did use soaked dog food long
      ago, if you remember, but that also smelled, was oily, and attracted
      tons  of ants.  But the Monkey Biscuits seem very pleasant and
      nutritious.  Water turtles, tortoises and box turtles all eat
      it but I don't feed it every day.  Twice a week is enough, I
      feel.  I soak it until soft before serving and it smells good
      and has nice texture.  A feed store like Wild West in West Sacramento
      might carry it by the pound or you could buy the 20 pound bag.
      It lasts a long time and does not get 'buggy'.    Enjoy the summer
      months, everyone!!</FONT></P>
