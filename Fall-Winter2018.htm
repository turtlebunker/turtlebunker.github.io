       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> - our FALL meeting will be held on Saturday,
      October 20th  from 1pm until ?  And we will (weather permitting)
      gather behind the Belle Cooledge Library to the right of the
      gazebo on their back lawn and hopefully the picnic table and
      benches will be available as they were last time.  If we are
      lucky, the gazebo will be empty and we will be able to use it.
       I don't want to 'reserve' it because someone will have to be
      there by 11 AM and 'hold' it for us.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Feel free to bring your turtle
      or tortoise for a pre-hibernation checkup.  I'm not sure who
      will be doing this but most of us are long term tortoise keepers
      and can judge pretty well whether or not a turtle or tortoise
      is healthy enough to make it through the winter months.  If your
      pet has already decided to go to sleep for the winter, please
      leave it alone and do not bring it to the meeting.   If it had
      been eating and acting normally with clear eyes - I would say
      it is safe to allow it to hibernate.  But where?  Well, I allow
      mine to sleep wherever they want to and hope it is not in an
      area that could flood.  Some species do well if the ground is
      wet but others, such as desert tortoises, could become sick and
      die if they are hibernating in a very moist area.  So try to
      be aware of where they have decided to sleep.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you prefer your pet not to
      sleep, that is ok too.  There is no 'law' that says it 'has'
      to hibernate.  And if you are uncomfortable with it, keep it
      awake indoors.   We can help with that.  And don't read too much
      about it on You Tube because most of that information is not
      appropriate for our area of the United States!  This is not Chicago
      or North Dakota!   Lucky us!!!  <BR>
                                                              <BR>
      The <B>TURTLERAMA</B> was well attended last June 2 and it was
      a good choice of a date because the temperature was only a little
      over 90 degrees and I did hear a few complaints, however, every
      weekend throughout the summer had 100+ degree temperatures. 
       Thanks to all of my club members and helpers for making the
      event a success.  Tracy and Steve lugged their huge Sulcata,
      Ben, to the event in a horse trailer and set up all of the canopies
      for us&#133;&#133;.I believe we had the same exhibitors as last
      year which included Terri, KC, Melissa, Susan, Craig showed her
      walking sticks, Corrine, Linda (we love your water plants) Sally,
      Michael,  Robin brought his Greek babies.  Terri Sheffield also
      had her redfoot tortoise on display and helped the children at
      the Kids Korner Krafts.  I think we should have the event in
      June next year as well, does everyone agree????.  By the way,
      thanks to my neighbor, Brian, who jumped the battery in my old
      station wagon so I could get to the show&#133;.. Thanks to all
      who donated the plants including Ruby Nakano, a good friend to
      me and the club,  The leftovers came home with me and are enjoying
      life in my front garden.   MANY THANKS to Incredible Pets for
      allowing us to have the event. </FONT></P>

      The year went by very fast, it seemed to me.  I apologize for
      not having the Box Turtle Blowout<BR>
      I kept talking about.  There just didn't seem to be enough time
      to put an event like that together<BR>
      plus the weather was so hot each weekend and there is no shade
      in my driveway.  Maybe next<BR>
      year I can set up one of those tents (if anyone is willing to
      help?)  I have one here.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> At this time, I am making sure
      everyone is healthy enough to hibernate and also cleaning up
      the greenhouse for this year's  inhabitants.  They will include
      African tortoises such as Leopards,   the two redfoots, and any
      other species who refuse to sleep!  I do not have any Sulcatas
      which is good because I think they would try to break through
      the glass.  They do not like to be enclosed.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Sometimes the Leopards become
      restless but it does not last too long.  At least I get some
      rest during November, December and January.   Fat Betty is still
      being naughty, hiding where I can hardly see her (she has lost
      some weight I guess?) and Just Jim and Suzi are still carrying
      on like newlyweds and in fact, they had 11 babies this year.
       The first one hatched too early and did not survive.  I did
      buy a large rabbit hutch so the little ones could be on the grass
      and safe from predators and it has worked out very well.   It
      was from Wayfair. They have a great variety of cages if anyone
      is interested.  A lot of them are for chickens and rabbits but
      work for tortoises as well.  Club members Stelios and his son
      Anthony kindly put it together for me which was GREAT.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Believe it or not, Chester, the
      Elongata, is still alive.  He was turned over to me before<BR>
       I ever started the club and was just doing adoptions for TEAM.
       And that would have been about 1977.  And he was fully grown
      at that time.  Amazing longevity.  He still lumbers over to the
      back porch steps to the kitchen at midnight a few times a week
      awaiting a banana. And I dutifully obey!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Before I close, I want to tell
      you what just happened after the last sentence.  I am watching
      a small desert tortoise for a few weeks and as I was typing,
      I could hear a scratching sound in the wall?  So I got up and
      went into the laundry room with a flashlight and sure enough,
      there was the tortoise behind the dryer.  She is still there
      and I will ask my neighbor to help me move the dryer if she does
      not come out by herself.  She did this a week ago and then suddenly
      appeared so she CAN get out.  She simply walked into the family
      room and then the laundry room from the back porch.  Smart cookie.
       HOWEVER,  as I pointed my flashlight into the tiny place  between
      the washer and dryer, I spotted something shiny wedged in between&#133;...My
      heart skipped a beat.........could it be???  YES, it was the
      missing original keys to my van! FOUND AFTER THREE YEARS!!  THANKS
      TO THE TORTOISE.   What a relief it is to have the keys back,
      I guess they slipped down and now you know - I NEVER clean in
      between the washer and dryer&#133;..DO YOU?   PS -I climbed up
      onto the dryer and poked the tortoise with a yardstick and then
      she ran out on her own!!!  And ate like crazy after that!  Two
      Happy Endings!!</FONT></P>
