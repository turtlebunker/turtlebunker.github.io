      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">From I-5 take the Florin Road
      WEST exit and proceed to Havenside Dr and go left (there is a
      light and turn lane) and the library is not far and is on the
      right hand side, you cannot miss it.  It is huge and beautiful.
        The meeting room itself is off to the left of the main entrance.
      We have the room from 5 - 8+ but I think if you arrive at 4:30
      there will be plenty of time to talk and walk around.   Father
      Dimitri will be at the meeting to conduct pre-hibernation checkups,
      so feel free to bring your pet to be checked out.   We can do
      the usual pot luck which will probably be your dinner!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Belle Cooledge has become increasingly
      hostile towards us but this summer,  at the Turtlerama, the new
      librarian, Donna Zick, came out to scream at me outside in front
      of everyone, exhibitors and visitors alike, about something she
      didn't like and was also yelling at Shirley about the sales table.
       We were accused of leaving the meeting room dirty which was
      not true.  I always take a photo before we leave and the room
      was spotless as always.  The same scenario happened at our Summer
      meeting a month later and then I got a letter telling me that
      since we broke the rules, we were banned from the library system.
         We were accused of not allowing the public into our meeting
      - the truth was that three girls, perhaps 11 years old, walked
      into the meeting room from the library and began helping themselves
      to our food and we politely told them to leave or bring in their
      parents.   A different librarian yelled at Shirley that day.
       We have had our meetings there since they opened 17 years ago
      but no more.  We are no longer friends of the Belle Cooledge
      Library.  We are welcome at the Robbie Waters Library and I cannot
      thank  Robbie and the library staff enough for allowing us to
      use the meeting room.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Looking back, the Turtlerama
      was a huge success.  You all did an outstanding job and certainly
      helped the public understand more about turtle and tortoise care.
       I'll list all of your names on the newsletter when I put it
      onto the website and let me know if I missed anyone and I'll
      add them on.   I spent most of the day in my car talking to people
      and signing others up and giving out care sheets, etc.   It actually
      was very enjoyable to have a one on one with so many people.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you have a new turtle or tortoise,
      please research as to whether that species can hibernate and
      if it is old enough, fat enough, and you know how to accomplish
      this.  Did you just buy one at the reptile show?  What you read
      on the Internet about its care is probably totally incorrect,
      sorry to always say this but it is true.  BE ALERT.  Your turtle's
      life depends on your care.   The best source of information is
      from other owners .  They will tell you the truth (I hope) about
      caring for your pets the right way.  They aren't trying to sell
      you anything.   And what about hatchlings?  Oh my, that alone
      can drive you crazy.  Do you let them hibernate?  How?  Where?
       Keep them awake?  How?  Where?  Very confusing. We will try
      to help you with all of these questions at the upcoming meeting.
       Hibernation is always a little scary, even for the most experienced
      keeper.  We never know............they hide their illnesses very
      well.  GOOD LUCK!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fall Hints: Know where your turtles
      and tortoises are!!  At this time of the year they begin to act
      a little nutty and squeeze themselves into the worst places imaginable
      where they could freeze or drown.  I like mine to hibernate inside
      of their doghouses but many times they decide to sleep UNDER
      the doghouse but some  manage to get out of their enclosure and
      head for the air conditioner where they will somehow push their
      way behind it or on some shelves or in a wood pile which is really
      really bad.  They will often dig deep holes very quickly and
      you won't see them again until springtime.  My Russians do this
      every year and I don't like it but there's no way to predict
      when they will decide to disappear.  So do your best to protect
      your little friends.  They don't realize you have their best
      interest at heart.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Summer weather seems to be hanging
      on nicely and everyone is enjoying the warm weather.  Blondie,
      the big leopard, has been in 'labor' for a few weeks now, digging
      here and digging there but not 'seriously'.  I got very tired
      of carrying her in and out of the greenhouse every day.  I prefer
      she dig her nest in the greenhouse so I know where they are.
        And she usually obliges but not this time.  A few times she
      simply pushed the door open somehow and got out.  This past weekend,
      however, there were a lot of  visitors coming by and Blondie
      hates visitors and runs and hides when anyone strange is around.
       She won't come out until the next day.  A few days ago, on a
      Sunday, there were visitors and before they arrived, she had
      climbed into the pen with the box turtles and decided to start
      seriously digging a nest out in the hot sun......there was no
      way to shade her.  And then the people started arriving.   I
      tried steering them away from where she was - but she eventually
      walked away and sat in the shade in a corner.  When everyone
      left, I put her back onto the lawn to do whatever she pleased.
        I made dinner and when I went out after dark to make sure everyone
      was ok, she was walking towards me and I noticed some white things
      behind her.   She had deposited ten big eggs on top of the ground.
        I guess she was too exhausted to dig another hole!!  Luckily
      none were broken.   I gave her a drink of water and gathered
      up the eggs, washed them off and put them into the incubator.
       Expected date to hatch will be anytime between Valentine's Day
      and March 8. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Everything else is pretty normal
      around the Bunker.  There aren't too many sick turtles to tend
      to but it won't be long since the weather will be changing pretty
      soon now.  Just Jim is getting so old yet I have never seen him
      as vicious as he has been this season.  I have a dog cage he
      resides in most of the day due to his constant harassment of
      mostly Tarzan, the male leopard tortoise.  He is joined by the
      new guy, Zappo the Wacko (another Greek tortoise), who enjoys
      chasing people's feet and viciously and relentlessly biting them
      (and mating with their shoes)   So he is in the dog cage as well
      when people are expected and I have not worn flip flops all summer!!
       He escapes from the various 'prisons' I have around the yard
      and the only place he cannot escape from is the dog cage.  I
      hope he didn't bite anyone at the Turtlerama.   The strange thing
      is that they (the Greeks and also the Hermann's tortoises) never
      seem to get tired.  They will chase people and other tortoises
      all day never stopping to eat or drink.  And the ramming is so
      intense - sounding like someone is repairing a fence.  All morning,
      all afternoon and up until dark.  Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam.   They
      WILL stop for a brief moment if I put food down, take a bite
      and then continue chasing and ramming.  I do intervene after
      awhile.   It's too bad nobody thinks about mating.  I just threw
      out 28 empty Greek tortoise eggs.  Sad.  One hatched.  It was
      a miracle.  That was little June on June 1.  An only child!!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Does your turtle or tortoise
      have to hibernate?  Not necessarily.  If you are in a panic mode,
      keep it awake indoors.  It will be a bit sluggish for awhile
      but as time goes on, will adapt to being indoors and awake. 
      I am no fan of artificial lighting mostly because people don't
      know how to use them.  The lights are too close to the turtle
      or tortoise and on way too long - common sense disappears!  The
      sun is not directly overhead 18 hours a day yet people read 'on
      the internet' that more is better???  Our eyelids would swell
      up too exposed to that much light every single day.  There are
      rainy days in Nature (not so much in Sacramento!!) so leave the
      lights off  when you look at the weather forecast for where your
      tortoises ordinarily would live.  Don't overdo it!!  Be alert.
       When you see those puffy eyelids, you know the light is the
      cause. Good Luck during the coming months, feel free to contact
      the club with your concerns via email, Facebook or whatever.
       If you call me, please speak clearly and a little more slowly.
       Most calls - well - people say their name and phone number so
      fast that nobody can understand it!  Sorry!  I play them over
      and over again and say  &quot;WHAT?&quot;    Happy Merry by the
      way!!   And a healthy hibernation to all of our little shelled
      friends.</FONT></P>

      crafts with them.  They were magnificent!!!  Kristina Sanchez
      and her daughter Ashley traveled up from Los Angeles to be at
      the show and Kristina was yelled at by the same librarian for
      trying to set up her dad's beautiful carved wooden turtles for
      sale.  Michael Rajkumar had a great display consisting of his
      Snakeneck turtle (Longicollis); his spotted turtles and a giant
      Mexican musk turtle PLUS an ornate Diamondback terrapin.  They
      looked terrific. Thank You Debra for serving drinks and snacks
      from the back of your car.  You were very thoughtful.   And thanks
      to Steve Tamantini and his Mom Angie for bringing the beautiful
      plants and Ruby and Alan Nakano as well.  What would we do without

      SUCCESS!!  </B>(PS - Luke and Lois were out of town for the Turtlerama
      but set up their beautiful desert tortoise habitat outdoors during
