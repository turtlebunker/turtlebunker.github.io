      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hibernation
      is a state a turtle or tortoise goes into at a time of the year
      when Mother Nature provides no food and the weather becomes too
      harsh for survival. In the wild, a normal hibernation pattern
      occurs year after year and the turtle or tortoise goes to sleep
      in his own carefully chosen area. Once he is a captive, however,
      it&#146;s a whole new ballgame. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.
      Many human errors are committed and it almost always results
      in a dead pet.<BR>

      Do not allow your desert tortoise to hibernate outdoors. Sacramento&#146;s
      weather and soil conditions in no way compares to the Mojave
      Desert. The tortoises must be dry and cool, around 50 degrees
      F. Box turtles are the most misunderstood creatures. So many
      are brought indoors and placed into an aquarium or cardboard
      box in a corner for the winter. Box turtles, in the wild, hibernate
      under snow and ice, below the frost line, so if anything, it
      is too warm in Sacramento during the winter! If turtles are in
      the house and not eating, they are slowly starving to death.
      Red-eared sliders and California Pond turtles do very well outdoors
      all year long. They will not freeze and they will not hate you
      because you left them outdoors while you are cozy by your fireplace.
      Put your guilt aside and let them do what comes naturally. Let
      them be turtles!! Of course, these instructions only apply to
      healthy turtles and tortoises. Always heed the following advice:
      NEVER ALLOW A SICK TURTLE OR TORTOISE TO HIBERNATE AND NEVER
      LET A HIBERNATING TORTOISE GET WET.<BR>

      is very full at this time in mid-September with vacationing turtles
      and tortoises. One adorable guest tortoise is named, Henry. Henry
      has been a pet for 36 years. When I saw him, I told the owners
      that Henry was not a desert tortoise, but a Texas tortoise which
      explains why he never grew large. It is Henry&#146;s first visit
      to Summer Camp and he seems puzzled by it all. There are no other
      gopher tortoises in the yard. He has never seen another tortoise.
      There are Hermann&#146;s and Leopard&#146;s, but nobody resembles
      him. He wants to fight, as Gopher tortoises do, but there is
      nobody to fight with. Therefore, he walks about, slowly bobbing
      his head at the various tortoises and waits patiently for one
      to walk away from him and then he begins to chase it. Most of
      the time, however, he sits by the cage of the year old Hermann
      tortoises staring at them as they stick their heads through the
      spaces. I think they like him and are expecting Henry to feed
      them. Henry did help me out at one point. He grew lonely one
      afternoon and decided to try to get Joltin&#146; Joe, the Marginated
      tortoise, to mate with him. As I walked over to take a picture
      of this unusual behavior I noticed something close to them. Oh
      Gosh! It was a baby box turtle......I would never have seen him
      on the lawn in great danger if I hadn&#146;t been on my knees
      with the camera.....so, thanks, Henry, for saving a teeny life.<BR>

      There were few eggs laid this year. Only a few box turtle dug
      nests and one water turtle. However, there was a &#145;first&#146;.
      One of the Yellow Cheeked box turtles laid three eggs. I&#146;ve
      had these turtles for at least 15 years and have never seen any
      eggs before. If they hatch, I&#146;ll bring them to the meeting.
      Just Jim Jr. and Just Jim the Jerk turned into unrelenting tyrants
      and have spent the entire summer in the Greenhouse for their
      own safety as well as everyone else&#146;s. They are small Greek
      tortoises and I don&#146;t know why they are so vicious. When
      people lovingly show me their cute little Greek hatchlings, I
      bite my tongue. They&#146;ll find out soon enough.</FONT></TD>
