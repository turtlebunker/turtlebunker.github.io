      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our winter meeting, AKA
      the <B>Slumberama</B>, will be held on <B>Saturday, January 17th</B>
      from around 1 until 3 or so at the Belle Cooledge Library located
      on the corner of Fruitridge Road and South Land Park Drive. If
      the weather is bad, we will cancel the meeting, however, throughout
      the years, that weekend has always been good! I'm not sure what
      we will do to amuse ourselves at the meeting but I think a 'Show
      and Tell' would perk us up, if you have anybody awake for the
      winter months, A Sulcata? A Leopard? Hatchlings?? Tell us about
      them. If not, I'll have to show a few videos!!! (YAWN) No matter
      what happens, we always enjoy being together talking about our
      favorite subject.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When I started thinking about
      writing this newsletter in November, we were having summer-like
      afternoons which totally confused some of our turtles. I do hope
      all of yours went into hibernation and you haven't seen them
      again. I wish I could tell you this is what happened here, but
      it's after Christmas now and even though our nights are sub-freezing,
      as soon as the sun comes up, out come a few of the box turtles
      and one Greek. I think the Russians finally got the message tho.
      Fat Betty is the only one who knows what to do and what time
      of the year to do it!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was wonderful
      from start to finish. I am always amazed at the number of people
      attending and the amount of food donated for our pot-luck. It
      was magnificent and thanks to all who brought those delicious
      snacks. Of course, the biggest thanks goes to Father Dimitri
      for holding his annual pre-hibernation checkups and deciding
      who will be able to hibernate and who should be kept awake. We
      really owe you a debt of gratitude for the energy and expertise
      you give to the club.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks also to Michael Rajkumar
      who gave an in-depth talk on artificial lighting. Many questions
      were asked and Michael had the answers. As most of you know,
      I have 'issues' regarding these lights which I'll discuss below.
      Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at the Slumberama!</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You've all heard me say, <B>&quot;AQUARIUMS
      ARE FOR FISH&quot;.</B> You can add, <B>&quot;FLUORESCENT LIGHTS
      ARE FOR POTTED PLANTS!!&quot; </B>Here's my thoughts for whatever
      they are worth. These bulbs have been around for a very long
      time. In humans, they are known to cause migraines probably due
      to the 'flickering'. I am constantly aware of the flickering
      but I'm not sure everyone can see this phenomenon. When the 'Vita-Lites'
      first came out &quot;way back when&quot;, we were told that the
      bulbs were good for at least 5 years. They weren't cheap but
      if they were going to last a long time, it was worth it. Then
      the information changed and we were told that they had to be
      replaced every year. And then, even sooner than that! It seemed
      to me that the tortoises were not the ones getting the benefit!!</FONT></I></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's a great discrepancy
      about the distance the bulb should be from the creature below
      it. Is one foot enough? How about 2 feet? Three? How long should
      it be on? 8 hours a day? 12? How about 16? Do turtles bask for
      16 hours a day? Do turtles bask 12 hours a day, 365 days a year?
      What about hatchlings? Do they bask at all?? Is the sun directly
      overhead 12 hours a day? Shouldn't these lights be on an angle?
      Who said these lights are for tortoises and turtles? I thought
      they were made for Iguanas, other lizards and snakes; creatures
      who can easily get out of the light when they want to and not
      be subjected to these rays constantly. Did anyone ever factor
      in rainy days? Some of our club members do, indeed, check the
      weather report for the area their tortoises come from, and use
      the lights accordingly. I think that is very clever!! If it's
      raining, out go the lights!!</FONT></I></P>

      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I don't use the lights for
      two reasons. If the creature has been outside during the summer
      months, no artificial lighting is needed for the winter months
      and also, when a tortoise is brought here because its eyelids
      are swollen, I ask if it was under fluorescent lights and the
      answer is always YES. Today, the LED's are becoming popular.
      I can't help but wonder what problems they will cause......<B>BE
      ALERT!!<BR>

      AT THE BUNKER</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Around here, strange things always
      happen immediately after the meetings. I was called into work
      after the Fall meeting (I am 'on call') on a Tuesday morning
      and needed to stay all day. The day before, 4 baby box turtles
      had hatched. I put them into a plastic shoe box which was &frac14;
      filled with damp soil to which I added bugs, redworms and small
      mealworms. I had a screen over the top and since it was too early
      in the morning to put them outside for the day, I left them on
      the kitchen counter.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When I returned after 5 pm, I
      walked into the kitchen and did not like what I saw. The container
      was still on the counter, the screen was in the sink, there were
      dirty paw prints all over the countertop and the baby turtles
      were gone. ! The cat was sleeping peacefully in the living room.
      I felt horrible. Why wasn't I more careful before I left the
      house? I knew the cat had a fascination with baby turtles and
      tortoises. I got down on the floor with a flashlight looking
      everywhere and found nothing. More than once a day I was on my
      hands and knees searching, knowing these tiny creatures couldn't
      last very long without moisture. A week went by with no sign
      of them. I felt so bad not to mention - ashamed!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But one morning, as I came into
      the kitchen, I noticed the cat hunched down by the patio door.
      He had 'something' in his paw. Yep, it was one of the hatchlings,
      unharmed. The same thing happened the following morning and on
      the third morning, he had the last two in his paws. ????? HUH????
      They were all unharmed. I thought he had eaten them. Do cats
      eat baby turtles??? I guess not. How could they have survived
      without any food or water for over a week? I guess they are stronger
      than we think.<BR>
      Regarding the cat, he does like to 'herd' baby tortoises. I have
      some in a wire cage upstairs on a bed and he enjoys sitting by
      them and if one sticks his head or paw out, Rocky will gently
      put his paw on theirs so they retreat. It's interesting to watch.<BR>

      FROM PAT OLSON'S BUNKER</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
      - I must take a moment of your time to share with you a recent
      experience (almost a tragedy) with the Olson tortoises. True,
      they should be hibernating, but as you know, Patches and Sweet
      Pea have constant runny noses so they cannot completely hibernate.
      We bring them in at night and they enjoy (I think) the heat wave
      we are having here. Strangely, Patches has taken to wandering
      all around the yard, eating flowers and exploring.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We have had a fountain in our
      yard for as long as we have lived here and it's never been a
      problem. It is three-tiered and the bottom pool wall is about
      12 inches high. Well, last Sunday, Patches did her usual wandering,
      nothing unusual. But by the luck of the turtle god, my husband
      went out to the garage for something and while walking along
      the path, glanced over toward the fountain, which was running.
      He noticed an unusual object submerged there. Yep, it was Patches!
      I cannot figure out how she climbed up and must have fallen in,
      but there she was. My husband lifted her out and set her on the
      lawn and ran in to get me. I was not sure what to do, so I tried
      to pump her front legs as I have read you should do. She resisted,
      no water came out, so we set her in the sun on the patio and
      blocked her in. By some miracle she is fine and even ate when
      we brought her in at night. I don't understand the whole scenario
      but one never knows what to expect from these fascinating creatures.
      Needless to say, we have put a fence around the fountain. The
      Bunker is not the only place where strange things happen!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But it's where this happened
      the other night. The time was 8:30 pm. The doorbell rang. A nice
      SPCA officer stood before me with a big female slider in his
      hand. I asked him where he got it from. He informed me that he
      had gotten a call from the veterinary 'specialists' to come and
      pick up a turtle someone had dropped off there. So, he went and
      rescued it and brought it to me. I looked at the turtle and said,
      &quot;Hasn't anyone noticed that she is dead?&quot;</FONT></P>
