      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our <B>Fall </B>meeting
      will be held on Saturday, October 22 from 1:30 until 4 at the
      Belle Cooledge Library,  5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822. 
      Father Dimitri plans on being at the meeting to conduct the<B>
      pre-hibernation checkups</B>.  Please have your pet in a box
      or carrier and don't pass it around the room.  We don't want
      to spread any diseases.  If your critter is already hibernating,
      please leave it at home.  We will try to answer all of your hibernation
      questions and help you decide how to accomplish it and if you
      prefer to keep your pet awake all winter, we have great ideas
      for that too.   Or you could do an abbreviated hibernation. 
      More on that below.<BR>
      	<BR>
      There will be more plants at the meeting including pond plants.
       Don't forget, it is also our 'Pot Luck' meeting so bring a yummy
      dish to share and don't forget some cookies or cake for me! 
      I believe there will be hatchlings (various species) for sale
      and adoption at the meeting as well.  Also, please take note
      of the fact that <B>all of next year's meeting dates, etc. have
      been scheduled and confirmed</B>.  So please plan your year accordingly!!!

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B>TURTLERAMA</B> was our
      biggest ever even though we were up against the State Fair! 
      I never expected to see a crowd like that, coming and going all
      day long.  I was told that approximately 1000 people attended!!
       We had a good assortment of turtles and tortoises on display
      and an extraordinary amount of plants to give away for any donation.
       You would have thought it was our very first Turtlerama and
      not our 30th!  Thanks a million to the following people and especially
      to Maria Lambert for compiling the list and also helping out
      all day long and then sweeping the floors after everyone had
      left while the rest of us sat quietly going over the day and
      resting awhile.  Here goes:</FONT></P>

      <B>Fall Hints: </B> Yes, Summer ended too fast and now it's time
      to prepare for a safe hibernation.  I know it's not easy, but
      try to keep your tortoises dry during hibernation.  In reality,
      no matter how hard you try, someone will come out of their safe
      place and get wet and muddy.  All we can do is be alert and do
      our best to return them to their shelter.  I did notice last
      winter that whenever the temperature reached 50 degrees, the
      box turtles and even a few Greeks would come out of their doghouses
      to sit in the sun.  If yours do this, don't disturb them but
      make sure they go back into their doghouses when it is dark.
       Food is not necessary and eating is to be discouraged.  If there
      is a freeze, do not bring anyone inside, ok?  Just add more covering.
       Do NOT break up any ice in your ponds.  They will be fine!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding an abbreviated hibernation;
       sometimes you have your favorite turtle indoors and/or some
      hatchlings.  If they go on strike and won't eat in November,
       then I would turn off the lights and heaters and let them cool
      down from Thanksgiving until about the middle of January.  Of
      course, keep the box turtles damp and the tortoises dry.  They'll
      tell you when they are ready to wake up.  And remember the following:
       <B><I>NEVER ALLOW A SICK TURTLE OR TORTOISE TO HIBERNATE AND
      NEVER LET A HIBERNATING TORTOISE GET WET!</I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For those following us on <A
      HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">Facebook</A>,
      you already know that the Bunker was under attack by a rogue
      raccoon most of the summer.  He or she never gave up the desire
      to kill and maim turtles.  Even with all of my motion sensors
      in place, barking dog alarms, he still managed to get some of
      the residents here and I have a feeling he was pulling them out
      of the doghouses.  He would arrive between 2 and 5 AM every morning.
       I would leap out of bed and be downstairs within 10 seconds
      of hearing the alarm.  I bought a new pellet gun, however, throwing
      rocks at him seemed to scare him off more than anything but,
      unfortunately, he would return several times a night.  I certainly
      was suffering from lack of sleep!  But it didn't matter.  This
      was WAR.  The State Trapper brought over a 'cougar trap' but
      nothing seemed to catch the raccoon.  As I write this newsletter,
      I'm not even sure it is over.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I did put a bunch of box turtles
      into the greenhouse because they were not going into their hiding
      places at night.  I hated having them in there because there
      was no way to take them all out during the day and then put them
      back in at night, so in they stayed throughout July and August.
       I had to weigh the danger of them roasting to death vs. being
      murdered.  Well, nobody died in the greenhouse.  In fact, they
      seemed very happy and excited to be in there, in such close proximity
      to one another!!  There was no more lethargy.  No more sleeping
      the lazy summer days away.  They were very active and seemingly
      having a wonderful time interacting with one another.  I do expect
      a bumper crop of eggs next spring!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the midst of all of this activity,
      Blondie, the leopard tortoise, decided that it was time to dig
      her nest.  (She didn't lay any eggs last year) She began scraping
      her back feet on the cement outside of her doghouse.  It started
      in late afternoon and would go on all night, but not resulting
      in any eggs being laid, of course.  Is this rehearsing? But around
      midnight, I would go out and put her back into her doghouse and
      try to block her way out for her own safety.  Of course, she
      outsmarted me several times.   Each time I put her into the greenhouse
      (I prefer her in there so I can get some sleep!!) she would immediately
      begin eating and then go to sleep.  In and out she was carried,
      yes, by me.....and FINALLY, on September 18th, she did dig a
      nest and deposited 7 eggs inside of it and one on the top.  She
      is currently outside again and behaving normally.  I wish I had
      some sort of a sling to carry her in such as people use to carry
      their bowling balls.  She's quite heavy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim and Suzy have not acknowledged
      one another since coming out of hibernation.  I keep hoping to
      see baby Greeks hatching outside somewhere but so far, nothing.
       There have been many adoptions this spring and summer and a
      lot of water turtles found wonderful homes and I thank all of
      you who took them in.  A note to remember:  When you fill out
      an adoption form, check back often (I tell everyone to bug me
      a lot) because when your critter comes in, I will remember you.
       If I never hear from you again, then I assume the interest is
      gone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I would like to encourage more
      of you to join us on the club <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">Facebook</A>
      page.  It is very enjoyable chatting back and forth about daily
      problems and getting solutions almost immediately.  Some people
      are offering their critters for adoption or some for sale.  You
      might find your dream turtle there!  Over 250 people are enjoying
      the site.  We'd love to have you there too.  Be careful tho,
      you may become addicted!!  But it's a good addiction because
      if you need an immediate answer, you'll most likely get it. 
      I've certainly learned a lot about ponds and pond plants from
      members who really know what they are doing!</FONT></P>
