       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our next meeting will be held on <B>Saturday,
      July 14th from 1:30 until 4</B> at the Belle Cooledge Library
      located on the corner of South Land Park Drive and Fruitridge
      Road. No speaker has been scheduled so far so feel free to bring
      a turtle or tortoise of your choice for Show and Tell. Are your
      turtles laying eggs? We'll help you to decide whether to incubate
      them artificially or just let them hatch in the ground. I like
      to incubate them indoors and usually have inexpensive incubators
      on display at the meetings. Please look at them so when the time
      comes, I won't get that panic phone call!! Be Alert!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Since the <B><I>TURTLERAMA</I></B>
      will be held 4 weeks after this meeting, we'll need to discuss
      things you might want to add or delete. Tell me what you like
      or hate. Thanks to several club members, we have a few new displays
      which are so well done and if most of the other exhibits have
      been used for many years, so what? They are still appropriate
      and besides, there are always new people getting started who
      have never seen them before.<B><I> Please share photographs</I></B>
      of your enclosures to be included in our photo display. These
      are most helpful to beginners as well as seasoned keepers - we
      all need new ideas! Please sign up for the show as well and if
      you are not at the meeting, email or call me to let me know ASAP
      if you can exhibit or help out. Thanks!!<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SEE YOU AT THE SUMMER MEETING!!</B></FONT></P>

      <B>Beware of the Internet </B>- I pretty well hit the wall almost
      daily regarding the information available regarding turtle and
      tortoise care. Most of the information is totally wrong. If you
      live on the West coast, why would you seek information about
      your turtle care from some unknown person in the midwest or East
      coast? The care is totally different in climates other than your
      own. Caring for tortoises in England, for instance, is a lot
      different than caring for them in Miami! No matter what you read,
      believe me when I say<B><I> do not</I></B> keep your turtles
      or tortoises on SAND. That is a huge NO NO. Who needs eye infections
      and intestinal impactions? And please, aquariums are for FISH.
      There is no such thing as a turtle aquarium. Please respect their
      right to have room to grow and outdoor sunshine to enjoy instead
      of some artificial light in a glass prison. They aren't African
      Violets!! Just this morning some guy told me that he 'read on
      the Internet' that male turtles are always larger than females.
      I had to tell him it's totally the opposite. BE ALERT. Don't
      believe everything you read on line. Refer to the nearest turtle
      and tortoise club for your information.</FONT></P>

      <B>Summer Hints:</B> Make sure there is lots of shade available
      so your pets don't have to walk too far<BR>
      before finding shelter. And try to have sturdy rocks and logs
      or even bushes in their area just<BR>
      in case one goes upside down. Sometimes (let's hope) they can
      maneuver themselves up to a<BR>
      structure and right themselves. Feed everyone on demand because
      it's their only chance to bulk up before winter returns all too
      soon. Box turtles, in our area, become very dehydrated even though
      they soak every day. It's the lack of humidity in the air - and
      you can remedy this by using a 'mister' or two. If the eyes become
      swollen, then let them soak in shallow water for at least 48
      hours. It's what I call 'aqua-therapy'. Try it!</FONT></P>

      After our March meeting, the weather seemed to deteriorate. It
      was cold and rainy until the end of May. The tortoises began
      to get so restless. They normally live quite peacefully in the
      Greenhouse throughout the winter months. By April they were ready
      to come out of there. The leopard tortoises began pushing, shoving,
      pacing and banging on the door. Blondie, Tillie, Tarzan Jr and
      Chester wanted out! They knew it was time. But it wasn't! Looking
      back on previous newsletters, I do notice that Spring seems to
      be arriving later and later each year. Global warming? Not in
      Sacramento. I am typing this on June 10th. It is finally warmer.<BR>
<BR>
      If I look a little sleepy at the meeting, it's because the Driveway
      Patrol on my pillow has a way of going off during the night causing
      me to leap out of bed and run downstairs to see what might be
      lurking in the yard. Even tho Rex, the electronic dog is on duty,
      I still want to see! So far, I've seen nothing unusual (meaning
      no raccoons or possums) since last December. Perhaps a passing
      cat sets it off. If you have purchased these units, please let
      me know if they are working for you.<BR>
      The Leopard tortoise eggs I had stuck into the dresser drawer
      last November because my incubator was full, successfully began
      hatching in April. I was very happy to see their little faces
      emerging. I am pleased that I can tell people, who have unexpected
      eggs, how to easily incubate them without buying anything more
      than a hot rock. The styrofoam incubators, homemade or commercial
      ones, work fine too, however, if you have cats, they like to
      sharpen their claws repeatedly on the foam and you soon have
      scrambled eggs inside. The dresser drawer incubator is beginning
      to look better and better to me. You just need to remember...<BR>
<BR>
      As usual, The Bunker had its share of red eared sliders turned
      in for adoption or into the hospital. Most have been adopted
      to people with beautiful ponds. Of course, more are arriving
      almost daily. They are mostly large females who have come out
      of wherever they were in order to lay eggs. They don't know their
      way back and when someone finds one, they take it home and then
      wonder what to do with it after first putting it in a box with
      a piece of lettuce in front of its face. Believe it or not, wandering
      Sulcatas are also becoming a problem. One was recently found
      walking down the street in Pollock Pines! I have about 6 of them
      waiting for new homes which I will probably bring to the meeting.
      None are very big (yet) and please do not adopt one unless you
      are willing to keep it warm through the coming winters no matter
      how large it gets.<BR>
<BR>
      There are also many Russian tortoises running through the streets
      of Sacramento. I imagine that they are the ones being purchased
      at Petco and the consumers are not aware of the little escape
      artists they have bought. These guys can travel fast and are
      strong and healthy and I have found that when people find them,
      they want to keep them because of their small size and big personality.
      They must be a little more wise about traffic because I've never
      had an injured one turned in. Isn't that odd?<BR>
      The big female slider who lost her legs to a raccoon (not here,
      thank goodness) is recovering nicely, even after a nasty setback.
      She will soon be adopted by Melody Herman who will give her special
      care for the rest of her life. Thank you, Melody. It is appreciated!
      By the way, Fat Betty is out and about and wishes you all a long
      hot and healthy summer.<BR>

      **Once again, please let me know if you can exhibit or help at
      the TURTLERAMA! THANKS!!<BR>
