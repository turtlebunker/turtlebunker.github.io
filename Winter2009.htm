       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Winter meeting (Slumberama) will
      be held on <B>January 16th</B> from 1:00 until ?? at the Belle
      Cooledge Library, 5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822. You know
      the rules: We will cancel in case of heavy rain, wind or fog.
      If in doubt, call me to make sure the meeting is 'on'.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am writing this newsletter
      in the middle of our big freeze, December 8th and 9th with temperatures
      in the low 20's and lots of snow and ice down into the lower
      elevations. I have been outside many times making sure everyone
      was under cover and added lots of extra newspaper on top of the
      box turtles and Greek tortoises in their doghouses. I didn't
      know what else to do. Please come to the meeting and share your
      expertise with us and tell us what you did to protect your shelled
      friends outdoors and also your plants.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Please bring a non-hibernating
      turtle or tortoise to the meeting for Show and Tell. You might
      be very interested in what I have to bring. I didn't even realize
      what she was when I first saw her. She looks very much like she
      was run over by a truck. Yes, she was kept indoors for the last
      7 years, a typical 'apartment turtle' with a parrot beak, extra
      long nails and a very flat shell making her appear twice as large
      as she normally would be for her species. You can try to guess
      what she is at the meeting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I was at a 'Dips for Dollars'
      gathering recently and I thought it might be fun to do a 'Desserts
      for Dollars' at our meeting. Bring a dessert (cookies, cake,
      brownies, etc.) and a dollar. You can vote for your favorite
      dessert and whoever has the most votes, wins the dollars in the
      jar. Are you in? Yes, we'll have our raffle too. Perhaps there
      are some turtle Christmas gifts you would like to donate? I do
      have two gorgeous cross stitched framed turtle pictures donated
      by artist, <B>Susan Tomko.</B> Thank you SO much for these beautiful
      pictures which will be enjoyed for years and years.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> was heavily attended and enjoyed by
      everyone. Thanks for all of the delicious food donations. You
      are wonderful turtle/tortoise keepers and talented cooks as well.
      <B>Michael</B> and I conducted the turtle and tortoise pre-hibernation
      checkups and I think we did a great job. <B>Dimitri </B>would
      have been so proud of us. <B>Craig Gifford</B> brought a female
      Florida box turtle she bought at the September reptile show in
      Sacramento. The turtle is infested with bot flies. Has anyone
      ever seen these? We usually read about them but never actually
      see them. It is truly horrible, even worse than maggots and difficult
      to treat. She has gotten some of them out of the turtle and saved
      them in a jar for us to see. They are bigger and fatter than
      maggots. We are hoping they are all out but there is a danger
      of them being inside of the turtle eating away at the liver and
      kidneys and other vital organs. Time will tell and we wish Craig
      the best of luck taking care of this sweet little turtle.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Don't relax too much because we are almost
      through with winter before it even starts. Watch for hibernation
      to be over for a lot of box turtles and Greek tortoises around
      Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, keep an eye on things outside. When
      the turtles emerge, they may go to an unsafe place to sleep some
      more if the weather gets nasty. And they WILL go to an area that
      floods. Count on it!! Be Alert!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">AT THE BUNKER</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After the big freeze, I hope
      there are turtles to write about!! It's been an exhausting experience,
      trying to keep the residents safely covered. Prior to the freeze,
      many box turtles were walking about each afternoon as well as
      a few small Greek tortoises. I know it was wrong, but out of
      curiosity, I put some food out for the Greeks and they would
      eat it which I did not expect. I thought that perhaps they knew
      something I did not know, that it would be a warm winter. WRONG!!
      It didn't dawn on me that Fat Betty, the club meteorologist,
      had disappeared in October which was early for her.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another clue was Just Jim Jr.
      and Just Jim the Jerk. When the Leopard tortoises went into the
      greenhouse for the winter, I released the naughty boys into the
      yard where they could not harm anyone with their relentless bullying.
      They usually patrol constantly, looking for victims to abuse,
      but this time they also went 'somewhere'. I know I sound quite
      casual about it, but there are a lot of doghouses in the yard
      and they usually find a suitable one to hibernate in or (gulp)
      under. They can't be 'put' anywhere because they will go through
      anything to get out and do whatever they please.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A very special girl here At The
      Bunker is 'Darwin', a completely deformed leopard tortoise. She's
      been here for 4 or 5 years and due to her deformities (apartment
      tortoise, folks, cooped up in an aquarium for WAY too long) she
      cannot walk properly, her body protrudes out from her shell exposing
      all of the parts which should be under cover. She is small but
      has put on quite a bit of weight and is like a little tank. Of
      interest, none of the males are interested in her. During the
      freeze, I kept a good eye on the greenhouse. Sometimes the tortoises
      decide to get off of the heat mat and then don't get back on
      it again. James is constantly off the mat. On one of my patrols,
      I went into the greenhouse and sadly noticed Darwin off of the
      heat mat. It could have been 9 hours since my last check. She
      was totally stiff and unmoving. I poked her and pulled on her
      legs and touched her face with no response at all. I gently placed
      her back onto the heat mat and resisted the temptation to bring
      her indoors. THAT is usually a fatal mistake because the sudden
      change in temperature is deadly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A few hours later, I believe
      it was almost midnight, I went into the greenhouse again to check
      on her and she was still in the same place, unmoving and stiff.
      I felt bad leaving her there because I didn't like the idea of
      the other tortoises having to sleep with a dead one. I knew she
      would swell and smell really bad by morning but I left her there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I went to bed feeling guilty,
      realizing I should have checked the greenhouse more often and
      decided I had caused her death. The next morning I reluctantly
      went out there but before going in, I looked in through the glass.
      Yep, there was Darwin eating a piece of cactus she hadn't finished
      the day before...........I went inside and gave that girl a big
      hug and told her not to scare me like that again. I'm very surprised
      that she didn't freeze to death. Has anyone else had this experience?
      I hope all of your turtles and tortoises survived the freeze
      altho we can't be sure until the springtime, can we? I was very
      worried about the Argentine Sideneck but noted that he was swimming
      about this morning with no 'floaters' visible. So far, so good.</FONT></P>
