      <B>Saturday, January 22nd</B> from 1:30 to 4 at the Belle Cooledge
      Library,  5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822.  (weather permitting)
       We'll talk turtle and I plan on bringing in some Round Table
      pizzas.  If you have a favorite, let me know.  Chicken Garlic
      is my choice.  Show us any odd turtle Christmas presents you
      may have received.  If you have anyone awake for show and tell,
      please share.  We'd love to hear how you are getting through
      the winter months with turtles or tortoises in the house.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was wonderful.
       Thanks to <B>Father Dimitri </B>for patiently conducting the
      numerous pre-hibernation checkups.  It was a lovely day so the
      table was set up outdoors.  <B>Just Jim Jr. and Suzi</B> had
      their wedding indoors.  I am not sure how many of you witnessed
      the ceremony, but just like the wedding of Clyde and Claire in
      1997, this one also seemed very solemn and real!  Their quintuplets
      were on hand as well. <B> Joy Cornette</B> created a wonderful
      tuxedo complete with a bow tie for Jim and I made the bridal
      gown with a veil for Suzi.  There was a marble bundt cake served
      at the reception.  Everyone celebrated!!  Sadly, a few days later,
      Jim cheated while on his honeymoon.  Upon learning of her new
      husband's indiscretion, Suzi started to accept the advances of
      a young Hermann's tortoise but soon came to her senses and ran
      off to hibernate all alone for the winter.  Jim is sleeping somewhere
      in the yard and I'll let you know how they are when they wake
      up in February or March.  </FONT></P>

       FACE="Arial"> There will be a special cake, well hidden, until
      the celebration begins.  I had to beg for the date and the next
      meeting dates are tentative because the 'rules' are changing
      again at the library.  I don't mind begging, pleading, crying
      or bribing, as long as we get our dates confirmed.  </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Observations At The Bunker
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">-  A lot of sliders came
      in for adoption last summer (so what else is new?) Actually,
      as I write this, two more are coming in.  I normally don't accept
      indoor pets in the winter since I have no indoor facility, but
      the weather has been so mild that I can acclimate them rather
      quickly.  One thing became very clear.  These turtles, when kept
      in aquariums, eat the gravel which is very obvious because once
      outdoors in the plastic pools, the pebbles suddenly appear all
      over the bottom.  And there is only one place they could be coming
      from.  Some are very colorful pebbles and others are larger rocks!!
       I'm not sure this is good for a turtle to eat and would advise
      anyone thinking of doing this not to.  Gravel is a breeding ground
      for lots of 'things'; germs, bacteria, etc. and is very unhealthy.
       If you must use an aquarium, add no embellishments!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Last summer, many of the box
      turtles here learned a new trick which caught on quickly among
      the Bunker residents.  I have a 'hotel' area alongside the regular
      turtle enclosure, sort of a 'summer camp'.  Somewhere along the
      line one of the box turtles decided to climb up the cement barrier
      in between the two enclosures and slide down into the guest area.
       Soon a few other box turtles followed and then the Russians
      began climbing back and forth, then the Greeks and Hermann's.
       It's completely odd to watch this activity all day long.  Back
      and forth they go, staying in the summer camp for awhile and
      then climbing back to their regular home often sitting in the
      sun to rest on the top.  I have to be on guard tho since once
      in awhile, a box turtle will be found hanging from a toenail
      after slipping off the edge! For some reason, the only turtles
      I ever see in this predicament are the larger Gulf Coast box
      turtles.  Some of them decide that they want to be out on the
      lawn and that's when they end up helplessly hanging.  No tortoise
      or 3 toed box turtle ever gets caught.  Maybe it is the shape
      of their shell?  Of course once they drop to the ground, after
      exploring the yard, they climb back over the fence to get 'back
      home'.  Tortoises are usually more cautious and won't go over
      a ledge.  Have you noticed that? Turtles go head first off of
      anything they are on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Honestly, with the mild winter
      except for a few nights in the 20's, not much is happening here.
       Everyone is behaving pretty well in the Greenhouse except for
      Blondie.  Lately, she has been standing up with her front paws
      resting on the glass trying to get out probably thinking it is
      spring?  I worry because she didn't lay any eggs last summer,
      but I see no sign of her wanting to dig.  A few times I have
      taken her out but then I have to hunt for her later on and lift
      her up (which she hates - so do I) and put her back inside. 
      Nobody else is doing this.  They have all learned to stay on
      the Stanfield Heat Mat and not wander off as Darin did last year
      in the middle of a freeze.  I am relieved not to be on my hands
      and knees rescuing any of them from the cold.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Brutus</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Arial">, the very angry Bell's Hingeback tortoise, is
      now in his new home in Santa Rosa.  He is an 'only' tortoise,
      pampered and loved and won't die early due to an overload of
      stress. He was not happy the day he left.  He let people know
      by purging his body on everyone and everything.  He was also
      chasing one woman in the yard and the more she tried to get away
      from him, the more he ran after her with his mouth wide open.
       There was something about her shoes that reminded him of a tortoise,
      I guess.  I would have loved to have kept him, mostly so I could
      write about him, but it wouldn't have been fair to him or the
      other Bunker residents.   He needed a quiet forever home and
      he has it with Kari who will keep us updated as to how he is
      doing.  So far so good, he is eating like a champion and is enjoying
      his new quiet life.   </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hibernation lasted about a week
      here and then when the temperatures rose  to about 50 again,
      that must have been a wake-up call because out came a bunch of
      box turtles and several tortoises for some sunshine and an occasional
      snack.  I no longer worry.  They know how to survive as long
      as we supply the right environment.  There's always a few tho,
      who don't do what they should.  In the rain this evening, not
      wanting to get my boots muddy, I took a broomstick and gently
      pushed a Greek tortoise back into his dry doghouse in the enclosure.
         </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For those of you who have visited
      the Bunker, you may have noticed the size of my grapefruit tree.
       I planted it years ago.  It 'was' a dwarf, however, it somehow
      grew very tall.  Over the years I have had it trimmed but that
      only encouraged it to grow more.  The numerous grapefruits grew
      as big as bowling balls and they would drop to the ground, breaking
      whatever was beneath them including several plastic wading pools
      with turtles in them.  One day a rat fell out of the tree into
      the pool below.  That did it.  I called my favorite guy, Roberto!
       <B>Roberto's Tree Service  916-470-9216 </B> The tree had to
      go.  And Roberto did an excellent job (as he always does, very
      reasonably) of taking it down and even grinding up the stump.
       It is such a relief to have that tree gone.  Now I can plan
      a new turtle enclosure where it used to be!!  The tree shaded
      half of the turtle pen until the afternoon hours.  They had no
      morning sun.  Now it will be wonderful.  I can't wait for spring
      to start working on that area.  Any ideas will be most welcome
      and any help too!! </FONT></P>
