<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, July 14th</B> from 1 until 4 at the Belle
      Cooledge Library located on the corner of South Land Park Drive
      and Fruitridge Road, off of I-5. So far, no speaker has been
      scheduled, therefore, let&#146;s have a Picnic Meeting. Teri
      has told me that members should bring food that starts with the
      first initial of their first name. I&#146;ll bring the Franks
      or Fritos. The Club will supply the soft drinks, so bring along
      your favorite snack I&#146;ll let you know what is going on in
      the turtle world and I will be able to spend more time with you
      individually. I know that a lot of you have special questions
      for me and I do see the disappointment in your eyes when I simply
      cannot get to you during our meetings. I do notice that you all
      enjoy being with each other and sharing stories about your turtles
      and there will be plenty of time for that, and since there are
      usually turtles up for adoption or sale, you will have more time
      to make your decision. The raffle and auction will be held a
      little earlier as well&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..and I think this
      will be one of our best meetings ever. Hope you can make it.
      Your turtles and tortoises are welcome also. Please secure them
      tho.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting was fun. Vicki
      Boening could not attend because she became a new grandma that
      weekend, therefore, I tried, unsuccessfully, to give a presentation
      about Aldabra tortoises after studying up on them. If anything
      good comes out of my effort, I now have a new display for school
      presentations &#150; speaking of which &#150; we desperately
      need some people to give short presentations at schools. I am
      approached mainly by K-1 &amp; 2 grades. The children have a
      short attention span at that age and a presentation of 10 to
      15 minutes is perfect. Bringing a turtle or tortoise or two sweetens
      the experience because of the reaction of the children and the
      myriad of questions they ask.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B>TURTLERAMA</B> is coming
      up on August 11. PLEASE let me know if you are going to have
      an exhibit or can help. You know how cranky I can be if nobody
      shows any interest. Please be at the library at 10 A.M. in order
      to set up before the show. It is a monumental task putting it
      together and I know we can do it again. We have to. There are
      always new owners needing correct information. Please please
      please sign up. SEE YOU AT THE MEETING!!!!<BR>

<BR>
      Runny noses don&#146;t amount to much in exotic tortoises but
      it can be deadly to desert tortoises. No treatment has proven
      to be 100% effective. Prevention is the key.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Call the Club regarding neck
      lumps in box turtles. These can be easily taken care of if you
      are not squeamish. When a water turtle has a lump, however, you
      could be severely bitten so it might be better to call on a vet
      for assistance. If your turtle or tortoise is limping and you
      don&#146;t see any signs of a broken leg, try pushing the leg
      gently inside the shell and placing a piece of tape over the
      opening to rest the leg for a week or more.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Turtles can survive raccoon and
      dog attacks as long as you keep them very clean and in the dark
      for a few days of absolute quiet and keep them indoors until
      their wounds are closed. Mother Nature is good at healing. Flies
      are their worst enemies. Go to a vet if the shell is cracked;
      if you see heavy bleeding from anywhere or if the critter is
      straining to lay eggs or kicking at its tail. These are true
      emergencies.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We certainly had a long and unkind
      winter. There was ice on the rooftops the day after our April
      7th meeting and all of the Bunker residents went back to sleep
      and who could blame them? The weakest never woke up and far too
      many calls were coming in telling of deaths, illnesses and raccoon
      attacks, not only in Sacramento, but from as far away as Georgia!
      Kate reported a wolf attack in England last summer and then the
      tortoises were stolen in the spring. Two were recently recovered
      which was a relief.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tarzan Jr., Tillie, Fernando,
      Junior, Blondie, Eleanor and Cooper, the Leopards, and Clyde,
      Claire and Chester, the Elongatas, came out of The Greenhouse
      on May 1st and the misbehaving Greeks immediately went into high
      gear and had to be put in a separate area for their own good.
      Fat Betty came out of hibernation 4 times before staying out.
      Miss America, a beautiful Leopard tortoise has come to live at
      The Bunker and she is an exact match for Tillie and he has been
      giving her his full attention. He has never been so happy. She
      seems to be enjoying him as well and they are together 24 hrs.
      a day.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Anyone visiting The Bunker has
      had the distinct pleasure of meeting the large common snapping
      turtle who has been living in a garbage pail for a year and a
      half after being found on someone&#146;s front porch and in spite
      of living in a seemingly horrible home, is thriving and getting
      way too fat and likes to play games with me. When he sees me
      standing by the garbage pail, he immediately stands up with his
      fat paws holding the inside walls and he sticks his large head
      up in the air and with his little black beady eyes pleading,
      opens his mouth wide and I am then supposed to drop his steak
      into this cavern. Either he is bad at catching or I have lousy
      aim because the food never lands in his mouth. I do not get too
      close for obvious reasons one being the utmost respect for my
      fingers. After having the pieces of meat bounce off of his face,
      he is smart enough to slide back down into the water to grab
      the goodies, which makes a frightening noise as his snout slams
      into the pail. WHAM!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">He is too big to be sent by mail
      where they are legal, so I am patiently waiting for some kind
      soul, traveling to Alabama or Florida, to take him along and
      release him in a safe place. Meanwhile, if you leave your turtle
      here, when you come to pick it up, I may tell you it&#146;s in
      &#147;the garbage pail over there&#133;..&#148;</FONT></P>

      At the meetings, do NOT give your pets to anyone without first
      checking on their credentials or background. Just because someone
      says they&#146;ll give it a good home doesn&#146;t mean they
      will. If they tell you they have a beautiful pond, they usually
      don&#146;t. If they say it will live alone, it&#146;s a lie and
      it will be mixed with many others. Often it will be neglected
      after the thrill is gone, or killed by predators. ASK FIRST.
      We have a fabulous adoption program going since 1977 and it is
      filled with responsible people who have proven to be excellent
      caregivers. TURTLES FIRST!! BE ALERT.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Shirley Waterman and I had the
      club display at Earth Day 2001 and The Animal Care Fair. Shirley&#146;s
      tortoise, Tiny Max, a baby desert tortoise, drew more attention
      than anything else during Earth Day. Since he turns himself upside
      down often (babies do that) Shirley had to bring him along and
      we let him walk around our table and so many people enjoyed seeing
      him and asking questions. And throughout the day, the same people
      would return again and again to check in on Tiny Max to see if
      he was sleeping or walking. It was great seeing some of you there.
      The turnout was outstanding. The Animal Care Fair had very little
      attendance. It would have been better if someone had promoted
      it. I volunteered to help with that next year. It was a shame
      because a lot of exhibitors were there and had gone to great
      lengths to set up their educational displays. Most of us left
      early, including the band. What a disappointment. </FONT>
