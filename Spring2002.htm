      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, April 20th </B>at the Belle Cooledge Library
      (corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge Road) from 1:30 until
      4. Our guest speaker will be Roy Woodward who will talk about
      &#147;Endangered Species Regulations and Amphibians/Reptiles&#148;.
      Roy will include information about general herps but will focus
      on desert tortoises as much as possible and wants you to feel
      free to ask questions at any time about a point that interests
      you during his presentation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Roy was born and raised in Fort
      Bragg, CA and now lives in Elk Grove. He holds a doctorate in
      botany from UC Davis and formerly was the manager of the endangered
      bird and mammal program at the California Department of Fish
      and Game. He traveled the world for several years working for
      Bechtel Corp. and is very active in the California Native Plant
      Society where he serves as the Plant Science Program Director.
      Currently he leads the natural resources inventory and monitoring
      program for the California State Park System.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As time permits, we&#146;ll discuss
      any problems you are having at this time of year. I am sure many
      turtles and tortoises woke up and went back into hibernation
      several times during the changeable weather of January, February
      and March and finally came out of hibernation with swollen eyes
      and runny noses. Often, they are dehydrated so you will want
      to soak your box turtles often and apply Terramycin Ophthalmic
      Ointment to their eyes. Make sure they go into their shelters
      at sundown since they tend to sit out all night if they are sick
      making them vulnerable to predators. Water turtles rarely present
      a problem and desert tortoises always present a problem. Don&#146;t
      let conditions worsen.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There will be a raffle and an
      auction at this meeting. Two small Sulcatas will be available
      but please don&#146;t bid on them unless you have the time, patience
      and facilities to take care of them when they grow to 100 lbs
      a few years from now and cannot get cold.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you have any quality turtle
      items you no longer need, please consider donating them to the
      club to help raise funds and a million thanks to those who have
      already done so. We couldn&#146;t survive without your generosity
      and DUES PLUS!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Spring Hints Worth Remembering:
      Tour the yard. Repair broken fences at the turtle and tortoise
      eye level because if they can see out, they will always try to
      get out. If there is a dog on the other side of the fence, he
      will react to hearing the tortoise walking back and forth by
      trying to enlarge the space, dig under and come into the yard.
      Clean up the yard as much as possible. Get rid of all of the
      little rocks the tortoises enjoy eating and beware of long strands
      of Bermuda grass. Put a spring on your gate so if anyone accidentally
      leaves it open, it will close by itself. I can&#146;t tell you
      how many times this inexpensive device has saved my critters
      from escaping. Watch for raccoons and opossums. They are everywhere
      and NOBODY is immune. Be prepared for egg laying and don&#146;t
      bother loosening the soil because the turtle or tortoise will
      never dig in a nest prepared by a human being. They loosen the
      soil by wetting it as they are digging. Patiently watch, but
      don&#146;t interfere. For indoor incubating hints, call the club
      for information.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The snapping turtle finally has
      a new home. Unfortunately, it&#146;s still in my yard. Having
      survived his second winter in a garbage pail, with no prospective
      home in sight, I went to the Home Depot and came home with a
      55 gallon Rubbermaid tub. My husband was standing on the porch
      nearby watching as I hosed out the tub and then filled it half
      way with water. The time came to switch the snapper to his new
      home. I turned the garbage pail on its side to dump out the water
      and as I gingerly lifted the pail up, my husband said in a worried
      voice, &#147;Is that &#147;thing&#148; going to kill you?&#148;
      I smiled as I slowly let the turtle slide from the garbage pail
      into the new roomier tub. I wasn&#146;t going to take a chance
      on lifting him up since he has grown larger and fatter due to
      his hearty appetite and restricted movements &#150; just like
      people! He seems quite content in his new tub and thanks to all
      who have tried to find him a new home back east. For now, all
      is well and we should give him a name. Any ideas?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Leopard tortoise eggs laid
      on the night of September 11, 2001 by Miss America were not fertile.
      They were odd shaped eggs, which I will bring to the meeting
      to show you. They were large and elongated and I suspect they
      should have been laid the year before. Blondie laid 6 eggs on
      Sept. 22 and then 6 more on that infamous Halloween night fiasco
      of wet hair, flimsy nightgowns, bare feet with a full moon lighting
      up the occasion. The Sept. 22 eggs began hatching on January
      22. Then on March 3rd, (which was my 50th wedding anniversary)
      my gift was seeing 3 of the Halloween night eggs, hatching !
      Who needs gold or diamonds? The next day, two more of the 9/22
      eggs began hatching. I know that eggs don&#146;t always hatch
      at the same time, but six weeks in between? I have no idea who
      the father of the hatchlings is. It could be Tarzan Jr., Tillie
      or Fernando. The hatchlings all resemble their mother who is
      named Blondie because of her light color.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There is a desert tortoise here
      with an above average IQ. At 1 pm Monday, 3/18, I put two desert
      tortoises out for fresh air and sunshine who had come out of
      hibernation. 5 pm &#150; brought one back inside &#150; the other
      one was nowhere to be found. 6 pm, finished dinner, searched
      for it, no sign. 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm, 10 pm, 11 pm &#150; searched
      everywhere, no tortoise. 11 pm to 7 am &#150; restless guilt
      filled night with the image of dead tortoises spinning in my
      head. Tuesday, noon &#150; missing tortoise observed emerging
      from the dog house on the covered patio after enjoying the evening
      nestled on the cats&#146; heating pad. He returns to this spot
      (the cat is not thrilled) nightly while the other tortoise simply
      goes to sleep wherever he is when night falls and I have to bring
      him indoors.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One of our club members recently
      contacted me because her redfoot tortoise had developed swollen
      back legs, could no longer walk and stopped eating. Upon going
      to the vet, it was discovered that the tortoise had a huge open
      sore all along the area where the skin and shell meet. On closer
      examination, the vet could see a rubberband &#150; which had
      wrapped around the legs, etc. and caused all of the trauma. When
      the owner was told of the rubberband, she suddenly was sickened
      remembering what she had done last summer. The tortoise kept
      getting &#147;lost&#148; in the yard and was difficult to find
      to bring her indoors at night. The owner decided to put a bright
      sticky note on her back and when that didn&#146;t hold very well,
      she placed a rubberband around the tortoise to keep it on and
      the rest is history. <BR>
