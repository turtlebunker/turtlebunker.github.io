      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will
      be held on <B>Saturday, July 17th</B> from 1:30 until 4 at the
      newly renovated Belle Cooledge Library 5600 South Land Park Drive
      95822. It will be good seeing you all again and I'm sorry we
      had to cancel the Spring meeting but sometimes things happen
      that we can't control. We'll have our 29th club anniversary celebration
      3 months late. I will trust nobody with the cake. It will be
      up in front of the room with me.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We do have a guest scheduled.
      Her name is <B>Elizabeth Koutsos, PH.D</B>. She works for <B>Mazuri</B>
      in technical and nutrition services and specializes in reptile
      nutrition which she will talk about. We are all interested in
      providing the very best nutrition for our pets so I am sure her
      talk will be very interesting and enlightening and extremely
      helpful as well. Questions are encouraged.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A lot of you began your own mealworm
      cultures after reading our Spring newsletter. How are you doing
      with those? I had a near catastrophe with one of mine. For some
      reason, it became invaded with ants. I have three tubs alongside
      one another on the patio and one day, one of the bins was completely
      inundated with ants. I didn't know what to do. It took me a few
      days to think about it and I took the mess outside and put some
      bran into another container and with tweezers, one by one, lifted
      out the unharmed beetles and mealworms and put them into the
      new culture. It took about 2 hours but I couldn't see throwing
      the whole thing out. After all, this is a<B> NO KILL </B>shelter!
      That includes mealworms, until they become food, of course! The
      ants then exited, and were very ticked off. I don't know why
      they invaded the one tub and not the others. Another Bunker Mystery!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In February, the DF&amp;G commissioners
      decided to stop issuing permits for the Oriental markets to sell
      turtles and frogs for human consumption. After years and years
      of brutal killings, the practice will end. I hope you will all
      agree that this is the only solution they could have come to.
      Thank you, Fish and Game commissioners for finally doing the
      right thing. And thanks to <B>Eric Mills </B>for fighting so
      hard for so many years to make it happen. Was it worth all of
      the aggravation and stress? YES!! When the current permits run
      out, no new ones will be issued. On a related matter, there was
      also some talk of banning the turtles and frogs from pet shops
      but that hasn't happened and I really can't foresee this happening
      either. Most conscientious pet owners don't throw their turtles
      into the river when they tire of them. But the ones in the markets
      have been released because people feel sorry for them.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I have a feeling that summer will be
      brief - so do your best to keep your critters healthy by giving
      them the right food for the species and the right amount of humidity
      as well. Your box turtles need a moist environment so try not
      to house them with dry desert species. They shouldn't be mixed
      together in the first place but I know many of us lose control
      because the tortoises and bhox turtles simply go wherever they
      want to be even if they have to climb and dig to get there. Hopefully,
      not out of the yard!! Keep things cleaned up; nails, hair, fur,
      rubber bands, baggie ties, little white rocks the tortoisees
      love to eat, glass, plastic bags...all pose a threat to our pets
      who eat anything when the temperature rises, especially the Sulcatas.</FONT></P>

      was a little disappointed last year because there weren't too
      many species on display. But the ones who were there were great.
      We still have our work cut out for us. The mis-information is
      everywhere and if we can save lives and make others more comfortable,
      we have done our job. Thanks in advance. If you won't be at the
      Summer meeting, please contact me with your plans to exhibit
      or help.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In our last newsletter, I mentioned
      how severe the winter had been, however, little did I know that
      it would continue on until the beginning of June!! I had taken
      the tortoises out of the greenhouse and had to round them up
      again when the weather went back into the low 40's. This happened
      three times. I don't recall ever doing this before. Once they
      were out, they were out for the summer and years ago, it would
      happen as early as February. NO MORE!! The tortoises were not
      happy being cooped up again and let their annoyance be known
      by depositing 'you know what' everywhere and in abundance! What
      can I say? It's all part of 'captive husbandry'.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Several years ago, my Memorial
      Day BBQ was ruined by Chester, the ancient Elongated tortoise,
      coming by to inspect the guests and leaving something behind.
      This year I decided to do another BBQ but let the guests stay
      in the house since the back yard was not yet ready for company.
      Speedy, the leopard tortoise, was visiting again while her owners
      were on vacation. Bill (hubby) was helping me cook and out of
      the corner of my eye I could see something coming at us at high
      speed. It was Speedy, living up to her name, with Just James,
      who bites ankles, in hot pursuit. He is much younger than Tarzan
      and can keep up with her and luckily, when things began to happen
      on the patio, our food was cooked and we quickly brought it in
      and closed the door.........As most of you know, Bill is not
      a tortoise fan and I try to shield him from any and all activity
      going on in the back yard. From now on, I'll do the outdoor cooking
      by myself.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Shirley Waterman's desert tortoise,
      Tiny, lost her vision a few years ago and Shirley has been patiently
      popping food into Tiny's mouth daily and when Shirley went out
      of town for a few days to attend her granddaughter's graduation,
      Tiny came to my house so I could continue to feed her. I'm happy
      to say that for some reason, Tiny has begun feeding on her own.
      Perhaps her eyesight is returning? Or her sense of smell is hightened?
      Tortoises are such a mystery all of the time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The saga continues on here At
      The Bunker with Just Jim being the bully and all other creatures,
      his victims, so he is now living with the box turtles for the
      summer months. Fat Betty is in there too but he doesn't bother
      her, however, the other day, instead of tending to forecasting
      the weather, she was laying eggs and I was keeping an eye on
      things. I had to come into the house for a few minutes and when
      I came back outside, a box turtle had come by and knocked her
      off of the nest and broke the eggs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">News has come to me that some
      folks at the Butte College have been removing red eared sliders
      from various waterways and in order to get rid of them, simply
      put them in boxes and FREEZE THEM TO DEATH. Umm, something stinks
      here. Years ago, freezing was an acceptable method of euthanasia
      for very sick turtles and tortoises to end their suffering, but
      certainly not for healthy thriving, active turtles. Articles
      have been published regarding this practice and how painful it
      is to freeze to death. As I said to Michael Rajkumar, 'Maybe
      the turtles butchered in the markets are the lucky ones???'</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Why are the sliders being removed?
      In light of severe budget cuts, who is funding that project?
      Are the sliders displacing the native pond turtles? Studies have
      not been conclusive. The pond turtles are a 'species of special
      concern' with no restrictions except for the fact that the F&amp;G
      is asking people to return them to the wild if they find them
      wandering about. I would say that human encroachment on their
      native habitat would do more harm than some sliders.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What kind of vet tells their
      client that their common three toed box turtle is an ALDABRA
      TORTOISE?? And with this information, the woman put it up on
      Craigslist!!! Why would a pet shop employee tell a customer to
      keep her baby Sulcata at 110 degrees during the day and go down
      to 95 at night????? The poor creature after three years of this
      is only three inches long and totally deformed. I beg you all
      to stop believing everything you read on the Internet. It's the
      WORST SOURCE OF INFORMATION. <B><I>The best source are the turtle
      club care sheets for the area in which you LIVE!!!</I></B></FONT></P>
