      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will
      be held on Saturday, <B>October 24th</B> at the Belle Cooledge
      Library , 5600 South Land Park Drive  95822 from 1:30 until 4.
       Father Dimitri will be unable to attend to do the pre-hibernation
      checkups, however, <B>Michael Rajkumar</B> and I feel we can
      try to fill Dimitri's shoes and will do our very best.  We would
      also like to have another <B>SHOW AND TELL </B>but since it will
      be near the end of October, please don't bring in a pet who is
      close to or already in hibernation.  Also, don't pass your pet
      around the room.  Let people admire it in the box you have provided.
       Many of you prefer not to let your pets hibernate and it would
      be great if you could share your methods of keeping them awake
      and healthy all winter with us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Even though there is food and
      drink at each meeting, we usually have our <B>pot-luck</B> during
      the October meeting.  Please bring a favorite dish to share and
      we will provide the refreshments.  There will be plenty of time
      to munch and mingle after the meeting and before the raffle.
       Speaking of which, if you have anything to donate, it would
      be greatly appreciated.  <B>Feel free to dress up your pets for
      Halloween. </B> Everyone seems to enjoy the outfits you all come
      up with.  Perhaps there will be a contest........</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The <B>TURTLERAMA </B>was a huge
      success.  Many thanks to:  Shirley at the busy sale table helped
      by Michelle; Dan and Sylvia brought their baby Marginatas from
      Concord; Jackie brought her large Sulcata, Thunder, to walk around
      for the visitors to admire (he was a perfect gentleman) and also
      her three spotted turtles; Susan and Glenn brought their desert
      tortoise and her very interesting grassy enclosure; Pam and Windy
      set up a craft and coloring table outside for the children to
      enjoy; Michael had his wood turtles and other turtles on display;
      The Reinarts brought their 100 lb. male and 70 lb. female Sulcatas
      to show as well as several of their hatchlings; Suzanne had her
      box turtles on display and Mary also brought her Sulcata along.
       I had three baby sliders there and Just Jim The Jerk, the Greek
      tortoise, and a Leopard tortoise; Jim and Suzi helped sign in
      new members (24!!), and Chris and Ernestine from the Modesto
      area set up their &quot;Kid's Corner&quot; indoors and did animal
      footprint castings all day.  The children (and adults as well)
      chose the footprint they wanted, they were casted in plaster,
      and then the children came back later to paint them and take
      them home.  Special thanks to Angie and others for donating so
      many great plants.  It was a wonderful day.  Thank you ALL for
      your tireless energy.  I think it was the best Turtlerama ever!!

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">, please don't let your pet hibernate
      if you see any of the following symptoms:  Lack of appetite;
       Decreased activity not related to hibernation (reptiles do not
      'hibernate' at room temperature; nose, eye, mouth discharges;
      coughing and sneezing; vomiting or diarrhea; foul-smelling feces;
      red spots on scutes; inability to submerge; any swelling or lump;
      including generalized swelling of body or limbs; cloudy or swollen
      eyes or lids; absence of defecation greater than two weeks; flaking
      skin or blisters; weight loss, even if appetite appears healthy
      and sitting out all night.  Be observant!  The signs are often
      quite subtle. <B><I> Please try not to go to the 'Internet' for
      advice. </I></B> Use your common sense.  Someone recently nearly
      killed their turtle by keeping it on sand.  She said, &quot;I
      read it was good on the Internet&quot;.  Good for what??  Sea
      turtles come out of the ocean and lay their eggs in the sand
      and don't hang around for lunch!!  Sand will ruin your turtle's
      eyes and if he eats it, which he will because it will be on his
      food, it will impact his intestines and he will die.  Call the
      club for help and we can direct you in the right direction.</FONT></P>

       FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Summer was as busy as always.
       All of the Bunker residents, new and old, were very frisky and
      it became obvious that many of the box turtles, after all of
      these years, figured out how to climb out of their pen and amazingly
      enough, were seen climbing back in again, like teenagers sneaking
      in and out on dates!!  During their escapades, they knew enough
      to congregate by the kitchen door by the patio and wait for the
      food to magically appear.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the middle of the summer,
      a young lumpy leopard tortoise was turned over to me.  I asked
      the  woman why she was giving me 'James' whom she's had since
      he was a hatchling.  &quot;You'll find out&quot;, was all she
      told me.  And 'find out' I did before the sun ever set.  James
      had a habit of biting ankles!!  No matter where I went, James
      would be right behind me.  If I walked faster, he would speed
      up as well.  He was quite a sight to see.  If guests came to
      see the yard, he would follow them too, with his mouth open!
       I've since named him Just James!!  He is a little better now
      since he has other tortoises to chase but he does have his moments.
       The other tortoises are not thrilled with him trying to mate
      with their girlfriends and Tarzan, who is usually a gentle guy,
      began shoving James across the lawn until he would tumble upside
      down and often he would continue rolling him along.  Everything
      smoothed out after awhile and I didn't have to put James elsewhere
      if I had to go away for a few hours.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just Jim the Jerk is still living
      in his harem and if I let him out, he immediately begins attacking
      the other tortoises so back in he goes.  I'm sure many of you
      saw him in action at the Turtlerama.  The smaller one, Just Jim
      Junior, is not quite as aggressive, so he is allowed to roam
      free unless I hear that familiar sound of banging shells going
      on.  Then it's solitary confinement for him as well.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the summertime, I decided
      to put a 'wall' in back of the box turtle enclosure because the
      residents sometimes decide to dig under the fence and have become
      trapped there undetected, with deadly consequences.  We found
      a great handyman and explained the situation and he put in a
      two foot high cement block wall.  One block is completely buried
      under the ground and the other two layers are above the ground,
      mortared together.  The area looks so much better and is now
      safe for the turtles.  If you need any work done in and around
      your house and yard, I highly recommend <B>Brandon  916-470-9097.</B>
       He and a helper worked all day in intense heat among a zillion
      ants and did a very very neat job.  Thank You Brandon!!</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  If anyone bought baby Sulcatas at the
      recent reptile show, when it quickly grows large, poos and wees
      like a camel and takes out your fences and destroys whatever
      warm winter quarters you have provided because they do not hibernate
      and constantly chase you for food, please know that it is <U>yours
      for life</U> because there are<B> NO </B>homes available.  At
      this writing, there are at least 8 of them on my 'waiting' list.
       Some are 100 pounds!!  Someone described a Sulcata as follows:
       'Take a large dogaloo, fill it with cement, put wheels on it
      and continually ram it into buildings.'  Nice!  Folks, please
      do NOT breed them.   You may get a momentary thrill watching
      the eggs hatch, but it certainly isn't fair to the tortoises
      or the people who might end up with them for the next 75 years.</FONT></P>

      They need to be in a SAFE outdoor pond.  They were pets and expect
      to be hand fed all of the time.  They would not be able to fend
