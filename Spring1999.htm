      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With the Leopards and
      guest Sulcatas in the Greenhouse, I was kept very busy feeding
      them and then, of course, cleaning up the mess afterwards. Most
      of the tortoises are overly friendly and will run over to greet
      me as soon as I step inside. A new resident is a fully grown
      Hermann's tortoise. He was turned in to the Bunker in December
      - which was too late for him to be put outside to hibernate and
      Hermann's become livid if they are kept indoorsat any time of
      the year. I had no choice but to put him into the Greenhouse.
      He blended right in and began falling in love with everyone immediately!
      This gives me hope that he will be a good breeder when he can
      go outside to be with the female Hermann's who desperately need
      a new boyfriend. And at this point, I can't wait to open that
      door and let them out into the yard again to eat the grass and
      enjoy the fresh air and warm sunshine. <BR>

      Last October, right after our meeting, I came home and spotted
      the large Leopard tortoise, Fat Toad (recently re-named KULA
      which means &quot;to eat&quot; in Kiswahili) digging a nest in
      the Greenhouse. She was living in there because of the cold weather.
      At midnight the hole was quite large and she was still vigorously
      digging. I went to bed. In the morning, I looked in and saw that
      the nest was completely covered. I had breakfast and prepared
      the incubator and then went out to dig up the eggs. When Leopards
      lay eggs, they add a lot of &quot;water&quot; to the dirt to
      make it softer. The sun was shining brightly. The Greenhouse
      temperature was rising quickly. I was on my knees with 14 curious
      tortoises sniffing about my feet and hands. The dirt had hardened
      into cement. The nest was very deep. When doing a job like this,
      you have to be very careful because you could slip and break
      the eggs. It took me an hour to dig with a popsicle stick and
      by this time the sweat was pouring off of my brow, my hair was
      a mess and my clothes were filthy and some ants found me. At
      last I got to where I was going. The earth was finally soft.
      The eggs were here in the bottom of the nest. I couldn't wait
      to see them and count them. SURPRISE. The nest was EMPTY! What
      a complete disappointment. Has anyone experienced this phenomenon?
      Let me hear from you. <BR>

      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Swollen eye or swollen
      eyes? A swollen eye usually means the turtle has injured it somehow
      by either rubbing it or walking into something sharp or fighting.
      Treat the eye with ophthalmic ointment 3X a day, trying to get
      it INTO the eye and the problem should clear up within 2 weeks.
      BOTH eyes swollen is not a good sign but don't panic. The turtle
      could be dehydrated. Apply the ointment 3X a day and also soak
      the turtle in warm water up to its nose as often as possible.
      You can add vitamins to the water but refrain from using Cod
      Liver Oil because it gums them up and makes matters worse. You
      can use Vitamin A capsules and squeeze some onto the eyes every
      day.<BR>
<BR>
      White stuff coming out of the rear end of tortoises is usually
      normal. It is uric acid crystals. A red/purple object protruding
      from the rear end which goes back in easily is normal male behavior.<BR>
<BR>
      Not eating is normal at times, seasonal changes, mating urges
      and egg laying times cause appetite changes. Constipation? Soak
      in water. Loose stools? Add fiber to the diet. Dry skin? Add
      humidity to the environment. Males jerking and twitching their
      heads? There is probably a female nearby they are trying to attract.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>RUSH TO THE VET IF YOU SEE:</B> Sunken eyes; blood coming
      out of anywhere; lumps on parts of the turtle other than the
      neck; badly cracked shell; constant squeezing as if trying to
      expel an egg or B.M.; any part of intestine sticking out of an
      opening that does not go back in; anything that looks or smells
      bad - IS bad.<BR>

<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Several years ago I brought
      home a 5 pound bag of pelleted tortoise food from the Reno TurToise
      Club meeting. It was a late October meeting and not many tortoises
      were awake to eat it so I left the bag in the laundry room. Around
      Christmastime I began to notice tiny brown bugs flying around
      the house. Of course they soon found their way into the kitchen,
      invaded the stove and got into the boxes of food in the pantry.
      I thought they were coming in through the patio door. Wrong!
      I finally traced them to that package of food in the laundry
      room. In order to spare yourself this pest invasion, be sure
      to put the dry food in your freezer. This includes dog food,
      monkey chow and trout chow and Pretty Pets turtle and tortoise
      food as well. Putting your dry goods in airtight containers will
      help keep the bugs from multiplying and ruining a great dinner!</FONT></TD>
