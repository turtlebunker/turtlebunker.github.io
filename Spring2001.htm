      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Spring meeting will be held
      on <B>Saturday, April 7th</B>, at the Belle Cooledge Library
      starting at 1:30 pm. The library is located on the corner of
      South Land Park Drive and Fruitridge Road off of I-5. This will
      be a meeting celebrating our 20th Anniversary, therefore, there
      will be cake! Reminiscing will be allowed so try to bring your
      own memories of past meetings and turtle stories to share with
      everyone.Of course, other turtle and tortoise questions will
      be answered as well. Don&#146;t forget to bring your turtles
      for show and tell. Raffle items will also be appreciated.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Winter meeting was well attended.
      I showed two of Andy Highfield&#146;s videos on hibernation and
      afterwards, instead of having a lively discussion about what
      we had just seen, everyone decided the meeting was over. There
      were plenty of snacks left, we held the raffle and we did a lot
      of socializing and it was great seeing you all at that time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The club has done extremely well
      over the years. Many of our original members are still in the
      club and I am regularly signing up new members. I notice other
      clubs raising their dues to $25 or even up to $40 a year, but
      due to the generosity of our members, I&#146;ve never even thought
      of raising the dues. By not raising the dues the club remains
      accessible to young and old, rich or poor, frugal or extravagant.
      The bottom line has always been getting the information about
      turtle and tortoise care out to the public and we have done a
      great job. Our membership hovers around the 975 mark, which is
      outstanding. I thank you ALL for your extra dues and donations
      and continued support, and that is why the club is so successful.
      Special thanks go to Shirley Waterman for manning the sale table
      under the most hectic conditions. I don&#146;t know how she does
      it!! She also sets out the refreshments. You are amazing and
      greatly appreciated.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Coming out of hibernation is
      almost as scary as going into hibernation. We don&#146;t know
      what to expect. Give your tortoises a once over. Feel the weight.
      Offer a drink every day. Offer food. If a few weeks go by and
      he is not eating, you might want to see a vet or call the club
      for advice. Some tortoises take a long time to become fully awake
      while others wake up and start eating immediately picking up
      where they left off before hibernation. Stop, Look and Listen.
      Stop what you are doing and pay attention to the tortoise. Look
      at his limbs and neck area for signs of sores or swelling. Listen
      for breathing difficulties. If everything looks ok, he&#146;ll
      probably be acting normally in a short period of time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty lied about spring coming
      early. She went back into hibernation when she discovered more
      rain and cold were arriving. Many red-eared sliders were turned
      in for adoption for various reasons, mostly because they outgrew
      their aquariums which are not good habitats to begin with and
      are difficult to keep clean. I thoroughly enjoy confronting people
      and telling them that aquariums are for FISH. Because it was
      winter and none of the turtles had been outdoors, they continued
      to live indoors &#150; in my laundry room sink, going out on
      warmer sunny days. They did fine and are now outside in the pond
      with the others, basking the days away. Anyone interested in
      adopting some of these precious homeless turtles? They have great
      personalities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I recently discovered one of
      my favorite box turtles underneath her doghouse. She was the
      turtle whose shell was half torn off by a dog and after I somehow
      managed to save her life, refused to return her to the family
      because I knew the dog would kill her the next time. She&#146;s
      had a good life here&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.but I certainly
      was surprised, when I lifted up the doghouse to peek underneath,
      to see her hibernating upside down! I have no clue as to why
      she was upside down. There was no room to turn over under there.
      As usual, it&#146;s another Bunker Mystery.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hibernation did not go well for
      some of the Bunker residents who chose to come out of their safe
      doghouses and, behind my back, go down into the large holes in
      the ground left behind by the rotting roots of the huge maple
      tree. I was afraid this would happen and my worst nightmare came
      true. A few days after my discovery, with a heavy heart and little
      energy, I had to clean out the water turtle pond because the
      sun was turning the water green with algae. As I lowered the
      bucket into the water to start emptying the pond, the first thing
      I saw swoop into it was a brand new baby red-eared slider. It
      took me by surprise, and as I held this very tiny turtle in the
      palm of my hand, tears were welling up in my eyes and everything
      fell into place at that moment. Life Goes On. <BR>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">SHELTERS &#150; DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH?</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A shelter is very important to
      our turtle and tortoises well being. Without a suitable shelter,
      they have no choice but to burrow underground. Chelonians need
      a shelter to sleep in, to get out of the sun or to escape a predator
      or another aggressive tortoise. Several can occupy a shelter
      and it is important to keep the shelter as clean as possible
      because there is a lot of pooing going on in there as well as
      hiding and sleeping.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Wooden structures make the best
      shelters. You can build your own as fancy or plain as you like
      or buy a doghouse &#150; but with doghouses, you should modify
      the doorway so it is only slightly larger than your largest tortoise.
      They enjoy the security of a small entrance and the darkness
      inside.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My tortoises do not have much
      use for the plastic igloo- like doghouses. I suspect the doorways
      are too large and the domes too high inside to give the tortoises
      the comfortable feeling they long for. I don&#146;t feel the
      plastic igloos give as much protection from the weather as the
      wooden shelters do.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Box turtles enjoy being in small
      doghouses or wooden structures not much larger than they are
      and you will often find several of them cramming themselves together
      in the tiny space. Mine prefer to be underneath the doghouses
      and homemade shelters and it is amazing to see absolutely no
      turtles inside of the doghouses and all of these little faces,
      including the face of the frog, peering out from underneath when
      food is expected.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For water turtle shelters, I&#146;ve
      been recommending adding a Spanish style roof tile to the pond
      forming a &#147;cave&#148; enabling the turtles and even your
      goldfish, the opportunity to hide in case of a raccoon or possum
      attack. Other than that, water turtles don&#146;t seem to require
      hiding places and plunge into the &#147;safety&#148; of their
      pond if they feel threatened, although baby turtles need a lot
      of plants and driftwood in order to hide from natural predators
      such as birds. </FONT>
