       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Fall meeting will be held on <U>Saturday,
      October 21st from 1:30 until 4 at the Belle Cooledge Library</U>
      located on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge Road
      close to I-5. We will be doing pre-hibernation checkups and your
      resident 'experts' will be on hand to help you decide whether
      or not your pet is healthy enough to make it through the long
      cold winter months. If your turtle or tortoise is already asleep,
      please do not wake it up to bring to the meeting. And if your
      pet is obviously ill with a runny nose and/or swollen eyes, please
      leave it at home and give us a call. We don't want to spread
      diseases around the meeting room. It would help if you could
      write down your questions and concerns ahead of time in order
      to keep the line moving smoothly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It will also be our <B><U>pot-luck
      meeting</U></B> so feel free to bring a dish to share and the
      Club will supply the soft drinks. The Florida Turtle and Tortoise
      Club recently had a turtle shaped food contest and although I
      don't think we will have time for a contest, bring something
      to eat shaped like a turtle. Someone brought bread, shaped like
      a turtle, to the Turtlerama and it was quite a hit. As an idea,
      I have a turtle jello mold and have used it for making chicken
      or tuna spread. Let's see what you can come up with. Perhaps
      there will be a prize for the most creative dish. Also, if anyone
      wants to <B><U>dress up their turtle for Halloween</U></B>, we
      would love to see the costume. In light of the world's troubles,
      we need some laughs, don't we?<BR>
<BR>
      The<B><I> TURTLERAMA</I></B> was a huge success. There were loads
      of people coming through and looking at the displays all day
      long. The displays and exhibits were numerous and all of the
      turtles and tortoises you brought to show looked healthy and
      well cared for and you all did a wonderful job educating the
      public. You helped people decide whether they wanted a tortoise
      or a turtle and discouraged them if they really had no way of
      caring for it. I am so proud of all of you. Because of your expertise,
      a whole bunch of turtles won't be in fish aquariums and fewer
      box turtles will be in a cardboard box in the corner of someone's
      bedroom, totally forgotten until it smells. Thanks a MILLION
      to all who participated and helped clean up at the end and to
      George Chambers for helping me get the water out of the aquarium
      after everyone had left. All he had to bail the water out with
      was an empty soda can.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><U>LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT THE MEETING!</U></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tortoise Hatchlings? </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Anyone who has hatched tortoise eggs
      has seen pieces of shell stuck to the baby. My advice is to keep
      them moist at all times because if the egg-shell dries hard,
      it could cut the yolk sac and cause a sudden tragic death. Betty
      Burge, Chairman of the Tortoise Group in Las Vegas suggests the
      following: &quot;If you find your hatchling has a piece of shell
      stuck to its face, you will need to remove it carefully. Moisten
      a cotton-tipped applicator with warm water and press it around
      the edges of the stuck shell. The water should soften the dried
      albumin (egg white) that is acting like glue, allowing you to
      lift the egg shell. Several attempts may be necessary. Don't
      rush this, because the dried albumin acts like Crazy Glue and
      you can injure the skin if you pull too soon.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      <B>Lost Turtle or Tortoise? </B>I've had several more people
      thank me for my hint to look to the <B>NORTHEAST</B> if their
      pet has climbed out of the pen or someone has left the gate open
      by accident. The reason my own pets don't wander is because their
      pen is in the NE corner! Of course, there are always a few that
      insist on digging in that area along the fence line - so I am
      constantly on the alert. One did get through last year and was
      discovered heading towards the neighbors swimming pool.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Looking back at the Fall 2005
      newsletter was an eye-opener. I mentioned that we had only 4
      weeks of warmth. The turtles were thinking, &quot;Where's the
      Heat!&quot; This summer was even shorter. I believe we had about
      10 days of hot weather after the extended long wet cold spring
      and the turtles were thinking the same thing. I personally don't
      see any global warming going on at the Bunker. The only thing
      warm is my temper! And the colder the summer, the hotter my temper!
      In light of the above, Fat Betty is not sure of what the weather
      will bring in the next few weeks. She has come up with no forecast
      for winter and has not laid any eggs either. She didn't know
      when the time was right.<BR>
<BR>
      Some things, however, never change. Naughty male tortoises are
      at the top of the list. The Russian tortoise, Beamer, spent most
      of the summer in the Greenhouse. Chasing and biting and ramming
      every tortoise and box turtle he came upon was unacceptable behavior.
      I never had to look for him. I could hear him clacking on someone
      somewhere at all times. There are female Russian tortoise here,
      including Fat Betty, but he would rather bite the others than
      have a love affair and children. I also have acquired several
      female Greek tortoises, however, it makes no difference. The
      male Greeks have no interest in them. They only want to be with
      the male Leopard tortoises, Tillie and Tarzan, who are much larger
      they are and don't bite back.<BR>
<BR>
      Good news - After the Spring newsletter went out, several new
      homes for sliders became available. My life eased up with less
      ponds to keep clean and many of the turtles are in wonderful
      new homes. I notice, however, that most of the sliders are turned
      in for adoption during the worst time of the year - the winter
      months. Since they are coming from indoor aquariums where they
      never should have been in the first place, they cannot be placed
      outside. The change in temperatures would definitely kill them.
      So, my laundry room begins to fill up fast with basins full of
      turtles until the warmer weather arrives which is never too soon
      for me!<BR>
<BR>
      After writing the above, Blondie decided it was time to lay another
      batch of eggs. This presented a problem because I have to put
      her into the Greenhouse so I can easily find the nest. It's always
      something, isn't it? I had to remove Beamer and Chester and scramble
      to put them somewhere else. It's a small yard. I run out of room
      rather quickly.<BR>
<BR>
      (Chester is usually in the Greenhouse to keep him out of trouble)
      You must wonder why I keep the bad guys. If I didn't, what would
      I write about?? And I do love them. I am also sadly drawn to
      the 'apartment turtles' that are turned over to me. I know they
      will never look normal again. Their beaks will always be elongated
      and their nails twisted and deformed, their shells sometimes
      oddly grotesque and soft. They were once normal, but living indoors
      in small aquariums does this to them. I try to make their lives
      as comfortable as possible, harden up their shells and stop the
      deformities from getting worse. It's the least I can do for our
      friends. We have to keep going in order to help people take better
      care of their turtles and tortoises.<BR>

      <B>What is V.A.R.K.? </B>Veterinary After Rescue Kare. V.A.R.K
      is a non-profit organization dedicated to giving unwanted animals
      of all species and breeds another chance by funding their medical
      care. V.A.R.K. was founded by <B><U>Jyl L. Rubin, DVM</U></B>
      to prevent &quot;convenient&quot; euthanasia of animals and to
      reduce overpopulation through spay and neuter programs. (You
      may have seen Dr. Jyl on Channel 13 news programs at noon in
      the past) V.A.R.K. currently provides services to the Greater
      Sacramento area rescue organizations, but hopes to become a nationwide
      service.<BR>
<BR>
      I'm telling you about V.A.R.K. because these wonderful people
      found out about our adoption program and the overabundance of
      red eared sliders and they are currently raising money to put
      in a large pond to help house the homeless. You can check Dr.
      Jyl's website at: <A HREF="http://www.drjyl.com/">www.drjyl.com</A>
       I will keep you posted on the progress of the pond.<BR>
<BR>
      Wishing all of your pets a healthy hibernation period. Don't
      hesitate to call or email with any of your concerns. If in doubt,
      keep it awake. Trust your instincts. And a very <B><I>Happy Holiday
      Season</I></B> to one and all. Thanks so much for your dues PLUS
      and your continued support. I couldn't do it without you. And
      thanks, <B>Shirley</B>, for keeping our sale table going no matter
      how crowded we are!!<BR>
