      mister (About $7.50 at a home supply store) and use it around
      your box and water turtles for added humidity. You&#146;ll be
      amazed at how the turtles will perk up.<BR>
<BR>
      Tortoises won&#146;t drink from a dish? It&#146;s more natural
      for them to drink from water trickling along the ground, so lay
      your hose down near them and let the water gently run out and
      you&#146;ll see their heads come out and they will stick their
      heads into the water. Watch their throats pulsating as they swallow.
<BR>
<BR>
      Keep the fly population down by keeping old food picked up as
      well as turtle and tortoise droppings. Please keep those water
      dishes clean because turtles not only drink the water but also
      defecate in it and you certainly don&#146;t want them drinking
      that stuff.<BR>
<BR>
      Be AWARE of your neighbor&#146;s spraying fertilizers and insecticides.
      It could drift over and kill your animals and you will not know
      what happened to them. My neighbor&#146;s gardeners use a blower
      and the dust comes over the fence and right into the turtle&#146;s
      faces. After seeing this, I now wet down the neighbors yard near
      the fence the night before the gardeners are due. <BR>
<BR>
      Since we are experiencing a shortened summer period, make sure
      that everyone eats well during this season and take care of any
      hint of a problem such as a swollen eye, a bubble appearing or
      a lump or swelling, at once before fall sets in. Don&#146;t wait
      until &#145;tomorrow&#146;. <BR>
<BR>
      If your veterinarian wants to anesthetize your tortoise or turtle
      in order to give it medication, I strongly urge you to see another
      vet. There are many ways to coax a turtle out of its shell. Very
      often, the anesthetized turtle or tortoise does not wake up,
      or wakes up sluggish and never recovers, and is severely damaged.
      Why take a chance? Call the club for hints as to how to encourage
      the turtle or tortoise into cooperating. It only takes a bit
      of patience & ingenuity.<BR>
<BR>
      So far, we&#146;ve collected $85 in the B.I.T.E.M.E. (Brutally
      Inflicted Turtle Executions Must End)<BR>
      fund and it will help in our war regarding the &#147;soup pot
      turtles&#148;. The Sacramento Bee newspaper editors condone the
      eating of a million pounds of turtles and frogs a year - yet
      publishes heartwarming stories about a couple of sea turtles
      that were saved and then released or they will run a story about
      a few desert tortoises being studied and isn&#146;t that wonderful,
      etc. etc. and I don&#146;t get it. All turtles and tortoises
      are threatened. What if a million puppies and kittens were being
      butchered alive and eaten each year? Would anyone care? YOU BET!!</FONT></P>

<BR>

      did not arrive at The Bunker until June, however, if anyone remembers,
      we had a few warm sunny days in April. At this time, a woman
      in Chico decided that she could no longer care for Tillie, her
      3 year old male African Sulcata tortoise. She called me for help.
      Of course, I agreed to take Tillie and find a good home for him.
      When Tillie arrived, I was surprised to see how large he was
      for his age, but he seemed mild mannered and his owners were
      happy to see that he was calmly strolling around the yard, sniffing
      here and there. Then Mistake #1 happened. The owner told me to
      put Tillie into the greenhouse with the other tortoises to &quot;see
      what would happen&quot;. Mistake #2: I did it. Within 30 seconds,
      Tillie turned into a tyrant. I imagine the sight of the other
      tortoises caused a hormone surge, one that seemed to increase
      into a total frenzy. We took him out of the greenhouse and then
      all hell broke loose.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">He began running
      towards the Hermann's tortoises who were sitting quietly on the
      lawn, enjoying the sunshine. Tillie not only charged them but
      rolled them over and over and even did this to Fernando, a very
      mild mannered Leopard tortoise who wouldn't stick his head out
      for hours after that! Then Tillie discovered the small Hermann's
      tortoises. They are about 3 to 4 inches long. He ran after them
      and tried to bite their heads off. All of this time, the owners
      were standing there horrified. They couldn't believe that sweet
      Tillie was acting so mean. Trust me, it gets worse. Tillie became
      so agitated that he began charging us!! And a charging tortoise
      is as vicious as a charging bull. We were running for our lives
      and he was in hot pursuit. Suddenly, out of the corner of my
      eye, I saw something move. Something was running after Tillie.
      It was Just Jim Jr. After what I saw next, let's drop the Junior.
      Just Jim has been resurrected!! Tillie weighed about 35 pounds
      and Jim weighs about one pound. Nevertheless, Just Jim decided
      to tackle Tillie, he just ran up to Tillie who towered over him
      and started ramming into and then biting his front legs. This
      activity threw Tillie into a tizzy and once again, his mouth
      was about to bite off Just Jim's head. I snatched Jim away and
      Tillie chased me as I was putting Just Jim into the greenhouse
      for his own safety. Those Sulcatas sure can run fast.<BR>
<BR>
      The owners finally left after I &quot;assured&quot; them that
      he would be fine and would calm down after awhile. He didn't.
      I was in a panic. Every turtle in the yard was in jeopardy. Every
      plant was in danger. Every fence was about to be broken and the
      greenhouse would surely be smashed. I did what I had to do. I
      went next door and said sweetly to my neighbor, &quot;Can you
      please do me a favor???&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      My neighbor agreed to keep him in her yard until I could locate
      a suitable home. As luck would have it, the next morning, she
      was shocked to see the back fence coming down.....her neighbors
      decided to repair the broken fence (which had been broken for
      YEARS), and now here was this wild tortoise charging total strangers
      and it was quite a struggle for everyone to keep the tortoise
      on one side of the yard while they worked on the other. <BR>
<BR>
      The story does have a happy ending. I found a wonderful home
      for Tillie, and when the family came to pick him up, well, he
      appeared to be gone. After careful searching, we discovered him
      way inside of a huge bush and he would not come out for anyone
      or anything. He was probably exhausted. We ran the hose because
      he supposedly did not like water. He wouldn't budge. So, his
      new owner and myself were on our tummies, in the mud we had created,
      trying to get him out. It took some time, and we were scratched
      and dirty, but we got Tillie out and you know what? He is living
      happily ever after. However, I will never be the same. Neither
      will my neighbor.<BR>
