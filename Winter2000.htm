      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our mid-winter meeting will be
      held on Saturday, <B>January 6th</B> at the Belle Cooledge Library
      located on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge Road.
      Let&#146;s try to get the meeting started at 1:00 so that we
      can all be home before dark and before the fog sets in. If you
      would like to bring some food to share, that will be wonderful
      and we will supply the refreshments. January 6th will be the
      12th day of Christmas and perhaps you want to show us some of
      the turtle items you received for Christmas. Bring them along
      for all to enjoy and &#147;ooh&#148; over, ok?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Since we have no guest speaker
      for this meeting, I plan on showing one or possibly two of the
      Tortoise Trust tapes and having a lively discussion about them
      afterwards. Can anyone help out with the TV/VCR problem? The
      library refuses to let anyone use the one on the premises, therefore,
      we have to bring our own. I will bring my 13 inch unit but we
      definitely need two of them so there will be one in the front
      of the room and one in the middle of the room so those in the
      rear can see and hear. If you can bring your TV/VCR combo also,
      I will have the connections to go between the two of them. Please
      let me know ASAP.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sharon Chancellor gave a wonderful
      talk about her Cuora Galbinifrons group describing the successes
      and failures of trying to get a successful breeding program underway.
      Club Member, Teri, decided to take up a collection to help Sharon
      with her vet bills. Sharon wanted to return the money because
      it was not her intent to raise money, but we had no way of knowing
      who donated. Therefore, Sharon wants to thank all who gave and
      wants you to know that she did use the money for the turtles
      X-rays and other tests that were performed over at U.C. Davis.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our 20th Club Anniversary will
      be celebrated at our Spring meeting on April 7th. Did any of
      you know that we started out as the Sacramento California Chelonian
      Society? SCCS.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After awhile it became clear
      that most people thought &#147;chelonian&#148; (pronounced with
      a K as in Christmas) meant chameleon or camellia. I was uncomfortable
      with this and soon changed the name to what it is today. We&#146;ll
      reminisce and have cake, etc. to celebrate 20 successful years
      and I hope many of the original members will be able to attend.
      It would be great if we could have a guest speaker for the meeting.
      Anyone willing?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thank you all for your beautiful
      Christmas cards, extra dues and donations and items for the sale
      table and raffle. It would not be a successful club without all
      of my very enthusiastic and helpful members. It is truly appreciated
      every day of the year.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fat Betty came out of hibernation
      on December 8th. This means that history is in the making. Spring
      will arrive in Sacramento before Winter. As you are well aware,
      Fat Betty&#146;s weather forecasts are dependable, therefore,
      when those salespeople call trying to force you to put double-paned
      windows on your house you can simply tell them that you won&#146;t
      need them because Fat Betty said so. <BR>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AT THE BUNKER</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">While most of the Bunker residents
      are asleep, or trying to sleep, the Greenhouse is full of energetic
      tortoises. Two new residents have arrived. As if I didn&#146;t
      have enough trouble with Greek tortoises, two more males became
      available. I was told they were deformed hatchlings and were
      living in Wisconsin. How could I not offer them a loving home
      in California? Upon overnight arrival, I opened the box and instead
      of seeing deformed hatchlings, out popped two lumpy full-sized
      males, obviously captive born and years past their hatchling
      days. And they were ready for some loving. Since they arrived
      too late to go into the yard, they are spending the winter in
      the greenhouse and seem to be having the time of their lives,
      running at full speed towards me as I step inside with food in
      my hands, heads raised high in anticipation. I&#146;m in LOVE!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another Sulcata by the name of
      Winston has been donated. He is 3 years old, but unlike the infamous
      Tillie who weighed 35 lbs. at that age, Winston is only 6 inches
      long and feather light. It was good that he was turned over to
      me before something unpleasant happened to him. As soon as I
      get him on a good diet and normal growth begins, he will be available
      for adoption so be sure to get on the waiting list for him, but
      only if you can provide for his needs as he grows and grows and
      grows and needs warm quarters for the winter months.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With the weather getting very
      cold and then warming up, the Bunker box and water turtles are
      not sure of what to do. Most days they are &#147;gone&#148; but
      on a sunny afternoon, quite a few are out there basking. Many
      calls are coming in regarding this situation from worried turtle
      owner and I tell them to &#147;let their turtles be turtles&#148;.
      They know what they are doing and survive quite well without
      our interference. If a freeze is expected, I&#146;ll put extra
      layers of newspapers on the turtles in the doghouses but they
      usually kick the papers out of the doorway because they are trying
      to dig.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks for all of your help regarding
      the &#147;sink holes&#148; in my back yard where the huge maple
      tree used to be. A couple of Russians (torts that is) have been
      spotted hibernating in the area but not too deeply. I&#146;ve
      been advised to bring in lots of sand or dirt to fill in the
      holes but for right now, I&#146;ll take the advice to leave well
      enough alone and watch what happens. If I don&#146;t show up
      for the meeting on Jan. 6, you&#146;ll know where to find me.
      Bring a shovel.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">IMPORTANT FACTS TO KNOW</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some tortoises are more difficult
      to keep than others as many of you have found out the hard way.
      Star tortoises as well as Forest Hingebacks do not seem to adapt
      well to captivity nor do Ornate box turtles. Some people are
      successful with these species but they are few and far between.
      Mostly I hear heartbreaking stores from their owners.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The easiest tortoise to keep
      is a Russian because of its small size and huge personality.
      They are also quite hardy which is a plus and are able to hibernate
      in harsh conditions. Other small sized hardy tortoises are the
      Greek and Hermann&#146;s, all being extremely friendly and never
      shy as most Leopard tortoises are. Sometimes it takes years before
      an owner actually sees his Leopard tortoises face. Most of the
      time, if a Leopard hears a human approaching, he will let out
      a hiss and pull his head as far in as possible and cover the
      area with his front legs. And he will remain in this position
      for an uncomfortably long time. Before you add to your collection,
      give it some extra thought. You will be glad you did.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">And Finally&#133;&#133;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I hope your turtles and tortoises
      are having a safe hibernation. It is best to let them sleep as
      nature intended, no matter how much we miss them and worry worry
      worry. Use this &#147;down&#148; time to improve their living
      conditions outdoors by cleaning up debris as best you can. Paint
      their doghouses long before they wake up so the paint will be
      thoroughly dry. Try to correct any dangerous conditions in their
      habitat. Make sure there are no long strands of Bermuda grass
      lurking about to entangle them. Keep larger rocks away from the
      fence line because sometimes they wedge themselves between the
      rock and fence and perish when the sun finds them before you
      do. Make certain they are in no danger of flooding at any time
      of the year. Crawl on your knees at their level to discover the
      dangers. They don&#146;t close their eyes when walking into a
      cactus&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.ugh&#133;&#133;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your neighbors have dogs,
      inspect the fence lines daily for signs of the dogs digging or
      trying to break the fence in order to get to your turtles. It
      happens very often. It even happened here.</FONT></P>
