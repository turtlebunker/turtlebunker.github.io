       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Our Winter meeting will be held on <B>Saturday,
      January 20th </B>at Round Table Pizza on Florin Road next to
      Bel Air from 2 until 5pm.  We will have the sale table there
      and raffle off some better quality items with the tortoise stepping
      stone being the top prize.  We'll be discussing the upcoming
      year's events and where to have them!!  We may have sunk our
      own ship at the last 'meeting' at Belle Cooledge.   The reason
      I did not get a confirmation of the meeting date was because
      I was supposed to go in to be told we cannot have any animals
      in the room.  Of course we already knew this.  And when we went
      to the library for the Fall meeting, for some reason, the two
      librarians came into the meeting room and asked me if there were
      any turtles in the room and I answered, &#147;No, of course not&#148;.
       When they turned to leave, they saw a plastic shoe box on the
      table next to the door containing a tortoise someone had brought
      for me to do a pre-hibernation checkup on........they didn't
      say anything and walked out and I turned to those few people
      attending and said, &#147;Well, that's the last time we'll ever
      see the inside of this room&#148;.........and we decided to skip
      the meeting and went to Round Table instead and had a very fun
      evening there.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I believe the Sacramento libraries
      have stopped the 'Read To A Dog' program because they do not
      want any animals in the meeting rooms.   It's a shame they would
      take such an important program away from the children who benefitted
      greatly from it.  I'm totally disgusted with this library anyway
      and the way we have been treated.  So, at the pizza parlor meeting,
      let's talk about where to have future meetings.  I really liked
      the Robbie Waters library a lot better.  It was certainly a lot
      more friendly!!  However, the same 'rule' applies there.  No
      afternoon meetings on Saturdays are allowed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Regarding our <B>TURTLERAMA</B>,
      it was a huge success as always, however, as the day went on,
      the heat went up and by the time it was over, the temperature
      had risen to 106 degrees which was higher than last year's 104!!
       So, who out there can predict the weather for 2018?   I'd like
      to thank the following people for their participation on that
      hot hot Saturday:  (Let me know if I left anyone out!)  Chris
      and Ernestine &#150; they did the animal paw casting again, thanks
      so much!  And they watched over the children in the Kid's Korner........Terri,
      KC, Melissa, Tracy and Steve (who lugged Big Ben the Sulcata
      AND his corral to the show to show how huge these tortoises grow)
      Susan (showed small Sulcatas),  Chuck brought his assortment
      of water turtles, albino's as well;  Craig brought her walking
      sticks, etc. Corrine, Linda, Sally,  Michael, and Robin brought
      his Greek babies.  Terri Sheffield also had her redfoot on display.
       Thank you ALL so MUCH for participating.  Hoping for a cooler
      day next time!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was not a good year for the
      residents of The Bunker. No matter how hard we try, no matter
      what actions we take against predators, no matter how much sleep
      we lose, there's no way to win against these nighttime raccoons;
      rats and possums; who sometimes find their snacks in our yards.
       Why do we even have these turtles in our yards in the first
      place? Are they better off in the wild?  Probably yes, but their
      'wild' is becoming less and less and we become the caretakers
      either by accident or on purpose.  My entire neighborhood is
      now overrun with huge rats.  People are doing what they can to
      eradicate the problem in good and not so good ways.  The Rat
      Zapper certainly works but catching ONE each night won't help
      with the growing population of these little scavengers.  Craig
      Gifford installed motion sensor spotlights in my yard aimed at
      the back fence which is supposed to scare them away.  I hope
      it works because I am out of ideas.  So far so good.  I can SEE
      the varmits as the lights flip on....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On the bright side, all of the
      box turtles and tortoises are ok.  The rats and raccoons only
      seem interested in the sliders for some reason.  Maybe because
      they are so easy to bite?  They cannot hide inside of their shells......We
      did have 3 baby Greeks hatch but the Hermanni's continue to chase
      one another without doing anything else.  The Bunker Residents
      and myself and Kevin the Kitty wish you all a VERY Merry Christmas
      and a Happy and Healthy New Year..... See you on Jan 20, 2018.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's no such thing as a universally
      ideal pen &#150; each species will have different requirements,
      some prefer the bright outdoors, others prefer the shade of the
      rain forest floor, some species like to climb, others like to
      burrow.  There are, however, a few general guidelines we can
      offer which you can then adapt as necessary.  We have kept hundreds
      of tortoises, of many different species, and in some cases, we
      have learned what works and what does not work the hard way!
       Here are some of the 'golden rules' we've picked up over the
      years.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">FENCES and WALLS</FONT></I></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      If a tortoise can see through it, he will try to pass through
      it.  So, ensure that all perimeters are impossible to see through.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Square corners just invite attempts
      to 'chimney up' them and escape.  It's better to have continuous
      fencing.  A gently curved or rounded 'corner' is much less likely
      to serve as an escape route.  (a triangle piece of wood fitted
      over each corner works well too) <B>Fences</B> should be of adequate
      height and depth.  Ideally, 1.5 to 2 times as high as the tortoise
      is long.  Many species are adept at burrowing and scraping too,
      so it helps if all fences are dug at a reasonable depth. <B>NEVER
      rely on temporary pens!!! </B> These almost always lead to successful
      escapes!  Tortoises are highly resourceful and determined creatures.
       If there's a way, they will find it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Beware of toxic substances used
      as wood preservatives.  Use safe alternatives and allow materials
      to 'weather' before use.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Substrates</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      Use an appropriate substrate for the species to be housed.  Desert
      species will require a sandy, very well-drained substrate, while
      many tropical species prefer moist leaf-litter, moss and crushed
      orchid bark.  Provide all egg-laying females with suitable raised
      nesting sites.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Design</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Arial"><BR>
      Try to make all pens interesting and attractive.  The old-style
      wooden pen on a grass lawn is NOT the way to go.  Contoured outlines,
      with plenty of internal space, alternative access to basking
      spots and shade retreats and a variety of places to climb are
      all prerequisites of good pen design.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Create an 'island' of interesting
      vegetation in the middle.  This will distract attention from
      the perimeters and will lessen the frequency of escape attempts.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If at all possible, provide slopes
      in all pens.  These greatly facilitate basking, nesting and are
      much closer to the typical natural habitat of many species.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pens for juveniles <B>MUST</B>
      be predator proof.  Rats and other predatory mammals can and
      WILL attack small tortoises &#150; usually with fatal results.
       Secure tops with wire mesh and ensure that perimeters are free
      of rodent or other burrows and check regularly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Provide juvenile pens with low
      growing vegetation.  This provides 'leg holds' in case the tortoises
      fall on their backs and helps them to right themselves.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Check all pens regularly in hot
      weather.  A tortoise can quickly overheat if he gets on his back
      and is unable to turn itself back over.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Install a 'mini-greenhouse' basking
      area in outdoor pens for use in dull weather.  These will provide
      protection from cold winds and will greatly assist in thermoregulation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ensure that all pens are free
      of toxic plants and encourage edible plants.  All pens need to
      be of adequate size, generally, the larger the better.  WE recommend
      allowing at least 10 sq. meters per average sized tortoise inhabitant.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With good design and careful
      construction, pens can provide an interesting, biologically suitable
      environment for many species.  There is no need for pens to be
      either insecure, inadequate or boring!  A really good pen will
      provide everything your tortoise needs throughout the summer
      months, and will prove an attractive addition to any garden.<BR>
