      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We are sorry to let you
      know that Felice Rood, the incomparable President (and founder!)
      of the Sacramento Turtle and Tortoise Club, passed away on October
      9, 2021. She was 88.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Proudly born in the Bronx, NY,
      in December 1932, Felice met her husband Bill at the boat yards
      on the Hudson River, drawn together by their mutual love of boat
      racing. They would soon start a new life across the river in
      New Jersey, followed by a brief move to Ohio, then to Sacramento
      in 1971.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In 1981, Felice&#146;s life changed
      forever when she founded the Sacramento Turtle and Tortoise Club.
      She became the area&#146;s most well-known advocate for these
      creatures, earning her the nickname &#147;The Turtle Lady,&#148;
      and would provide information to hundreds of members of the club,
      as well as adoption, medical, and &#147;hotel&#148; services.
      Four times per year she published a newsletter for the club members,
      and also held a number of in-person meetings, including an annual
      &#147;Turtlerama,&#148; which she treasured.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Felice&#146;s second love was
      rock-n-roll music, especially The Rolling Stones, Metallica,
      Foo Fighters, and almost anything with a Hammond B3 organ and
      spinning Leslie speaker. An avid keyboard player, she played
      at Carnegie Hall with her class as a youth, and enjoyed entertaining
      residents at Eskaton Greenhaven in the 1990s.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Her other passions included tending
      to her cactus garden, crafting, sewing, spending time on her
      houseboat in the delta, her beloved Siamese cat, Kevin, and always
      a cup of Pepsi on ice.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Felice&#146;s sense of humor
      was second-to-none &#151; she could find humor in anything, and
      wasn&#146;t afraid to share. She was a big fan of Howard Stern,
      listening to his show daily, and even styling her hair to match
      his curly locks. She was totally one-of-a-kind and will be missed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The club&#146;s Facebook page
      remains active: <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/groups/turtleandtortoise.1">www.facebook.com/groups/turtleandtortoise.1</A></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is with great relief to announce
      that all of the turtles and tortoises under Felice&#146;s care
      have been successfully re-homed. Thank you to several key Club
      members who assisted in this endeavor. At last count, there were
      more than 50 of them. A few more have revealed themselves since
      (yes, some of them are excellent at hiding) and we will continue
      to re-home them. Thanks for your generous donations over the
      years. All remaining funds have been donated to other turtle
      and tortoise rescue organizations.</FONT>
