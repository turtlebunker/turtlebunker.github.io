       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Our next meeting will be held on <B>January
      26th</B> from <B>1:30-4</B> at the <B>Belle Cooledge Library</B>,
       5600 South Land Park Drive  95822.  Remember, bad weather will
      cause a cancellation so call or email ahead of time just to be
      sure.  Even though it is mid-winter, your pets will start coming
      back to life around Valentine's Day so don't panic when you see
      them.  We'll go through what you should and should not do when
      this occurs.  My main advice right now is to tell you NOT to
      bring them indoors unless you see clear signs of illness.....l'm
      typing this at the beginning of January and some Greeks and Hermann's
      and a few Russians, including Fat Betty, and one Gulf Coast box
      turtle, are still sitting out on sunny days even after nights
      that are dipping into the 20's!!  Just Jim Jr. is out there too,
      but the 'Jerk' had sense enough to hibernate somewhere.  Fat
      Betty has not given reliable weather forecasts in quite a few
      years.  I guess she has lost her touch and retired??</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting was fabulous.
       We had about 90 guests attending and <I>Father Dimitri</I> conducted
      his pre-hibernation checkups and I hope all is well with the
      pets you allowed to hibernate and the ones you are trying to
      keep awake indoors for the winter.  We had quite an assortment
      of food for our Pot Luck and even I managed to get a good plate
      full.  Thanks you all for your wonderful food donations.  It
      was all delicious.  By the way, if you bring some food and some
      is left over or not eaten at all, feel free to take it back home.
       Several people asked for permission and, of course, it is fine
      to do.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">January's meeting is usually
      low key.  I think I will buy a cake to share since I just had
      an 'important' birthday and if you have a pet you would like
      to bring for Show and Tell, that would be great.  I have not
      decided who to bring yet, but it could be Otis, the slider I
      accepted into my shelter, who recently lost all of his limbs
      to a raccoon attack but is doing well.  Maybe you can help me
      decide how best to keep him safe and happy.   He is healing well
      and leaves no food uneaten.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I tried to bring this topic up at the
      Fall meeting but I didn't get too far.  So here I go again. 
      We've been invited to participate in the El Dorado County Fair,
      June 13-16th. This includes Father's Day.  I'm not sure how we
      can pull off this 4 day event.   I know that I could not be there
      for 4 days, 10 hours a day not including traveling.  I'm not
      even sure it would be a good idea to be there in the first place.
       It's very stressful for the turtles and tortoises to be on display
      for that length of time.  I don't know if we would be indoors
      or outdoors and I would love to discuss this at the meeting.
       So please think about it and we'll talk about it, bounce ideas
      back and forth and come to a decision.  </FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> You pretty much know the ropes by now.
       Meanwhile, on these long cold days, start going through the
      seed catalogs you have gotten in the mail and plan your edible
      summer garden.  Also, look over your turtle and/or tortoise enclosures
      and see what improvements you can make for the upcoming season.
       Try to make it as raccoon proof as possible by providing a lot
      of hiding places with small doorways not much larger than the
      turtle or tortoise.   Even if you have never seen a raccoon,
      they are never too far away.  Be Alert.  <BR>
      I am often asked this question:  how can water turtles hibernate
      under water......Water turtles can receive oxygen by water passing
      over their throat (pharyngeal) or by cloacal absorption.  Their
      metabolism is very slow during this time and they require very
      little oxygen.  These methods are what allow them to remain underwater
      for months while hibernating in their natural habitat which may
      normally be under snow and ice during the winter.<BR>
      Of interest, tortoises can have bladder stones in their system
      all their life without having any problems.  When the stones
      become large enough to press on the animal's spine, kidneys or
      cause other problems, it may still take years before the stones
      cause the animal to die....from the March/April issue of The
      Carapace 1998.   </FONT></P>

      it doesn't end badly.....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Raccoon attacks in the summer
      of 2011 were extremely vicious, and I was completely caught off
      guard that morning in August when I saw my sweet Darwin lying
      upside down near the back fence with one knee a bit chewed on
      and the other knee nearly bitten off.  Darwin is a very mishapen
      Leopard Tortoise whose body has grown out past her shell from
      her former living conditions.  The shell no longer protects her
      head or her extremities or her tail.  She can't tuck anything
      in and it is very difficult for her to walk as well.  She sort
      of scoots slowly along but she does get around.  Sometime during
      the night of August 11, she was pulled out of her 'safe' doghouse
      which is in an area which is well lit and away from the back
      yard, and she must have been rolled over and over and over into
      the back yard because she was too heavy to be picked up.  I don't
      know why my motion detectors neglected detect the movement during
      the night.  So there she lay, upside down with a mad beast trying
      to eat her, severely injured, left to bleed to death by that
      vicious creature who was not hungry, but only wanted to maim
      and let her die alone in the dark.  The worst injury was to the
      left knee which was now a gaping bloodless wound with the broken
      bones all sticking out.  Gruesome to look at, for sure and my
      heart was hurting so much over this dear creature who was looking
      at me with her black trusting eyes.   There was no blood. Mother
      Nature had shut off the blood supply to the gaping wound.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What to do?  What to do??  I
      kept looking into her eyes for an answer.  If I took her to a
      vet, they would absolutely remove her leg.  This was unacceptable
      to me because it was already very difficult for her to walk around
      and this would mean she would never walk again.  Her leg was
      not devoid of feeling.  She could move it which encouraged me
      to follow my instinct and treat her myself and whatever happened
      would happen.  I gently cleaned the mess as best I could.  I
      loosely applied a bandage around it (which never stayed on) and
      set up a new home for her on my screened in patio.  She was content
      out there.  She ate very well, always giving me those 'looks'
      and then she was in the house all winter, healing.  When I took
       the other leopard tortoises out of the greenhouse for the summer
      last March, I put her into the greenhouse so she would have more
      room to walk around.  The knee was still gaping but she was using
      it to walk and she slowly began to get more movement out of it
      for the next few months.  I finally let her roam the yard during
      the day in August, a full year after the attack, and she did
      manage to always make it around the corner of the yard on her
      way to her special dog house.  I made sure to have it toally
      barricaded at night to protect her from a rogue raccoon.  As
      of this writing, the knee seems to be changing and looking somewhat
      better and does not cause one to cringe and say &quot;ewww&quot;
      when looking at it.  Nobody knew of this heartache and complete
      anger I was feeling towards the beast who did this, and I revealed
      it only recently.  So forgive me for not going to a vet.  Darwin
      has her leg and that is the most important outcome after this
      horrible attack.  She is a very lucky girl and my heart sings
      when I see her little face every day waiting for her meal. </FONT></P>
