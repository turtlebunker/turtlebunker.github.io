      the following are hazards to look out for: little white rocks,
      hair, human and animal, poisonous plants, deep water dishes and
      swimming pools, paper clips, baggie ties, snail bait, bits of
      plastic, plastic bags, long strands of bermuda grass, tacks,
      broken glass, fish hooks, yarn, needles and thread, sticky cactus,
      bobby pins, swimming pool NETS and various chemicals, can lids,
      nails, staples - just about everything imaginable can harm your
      pets.Try to discourage your neighbors from spraying poisons along
      your fence line. If they resist, ask them to PLEASE tell you
      when they are going to spray so that you can move your pets to
      safety. don&#146;t return them outdoors until you have thoroughly
      hosed everything down and cleaned out the ponds and water dishes.
      Promptly bring injured pets indoors. (yes, some people don&#146;t!)
      Maggots KILL. Inspect the wounded area for maggots or an infection.
      If it looks bad, it IS bad. If it smells bad, it IS bad. BE ALERT.<BR>

      THOSE SCATS!<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#148;Scats,
      a term used when referring to animal droppings.&#148; Why keep
      them picked up? Most tortoises have some intestinal worms. A
      &#147;light load&#148; of intestinal parasites is not abnormal
      for tortoises or for any wild animal. In captivity where living
      areas are much smaller than in the wild, excessive contamination
      of the living area is a potential problem. Anemia is only one
      consequence of internal parasites. Microscopic eggs laid by the
      parasites are passed out in the scats. If scats are left where
      tortoises may eat, such as on grass, the eggs may be washed onto
      the grass from your sprinkler. The tortoise inadvertently ingests
      the eggs as it grazes, and this adds to the tortoise&#146;s load
      of internal parasites. This feedback situation can be avoided
      if you pick up and discard all scats as soon as they are found.
      Do not put them in the compost pile. Because some tortoises also
      eat soil on occasion, pick up scats from areas without vegetation.
      Some parasite eggs withstand drying and persist for a long time,
      ready to hatch when ingested. Place a putty knife and a small
      can where you can easily pick them up as you go out the door
      to tend to your tortoises. Make this a daily habit. Intestinal
      parasites can be a slow but steadily debilitating condition.
      You can find out just how your tortoise is faring by taking a
      fresh scat to the vet for a microscopic examination. Treatment
      is simple and a reasonable expense for your uncomplaining tortoises.
