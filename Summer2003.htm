      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Summer meeting will be held
      on Saturday, July 19th from 1:30 until 4 pm at the Belle Cooledge
      Library located on the corner of South Land Park and Fruitridge
      Road. We won&#146;t be able to have the meeting indoors but we&#146;ve
      been given permission to have it outdoors. We&#146;ll either
      be under the trees outside of the meeting room or in the park
      a few feet away. Please bring a blanket or a chair. The club
      will provide cool drinks and snacks. In the unlikely event it
      rains, the meeting will be cancelled.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To fill the time, I&#146;d like
      to have 10 members give 10 minutes of your time to talk about
      the turtle or tortoise of your choice. The talk could be about
      a tortoise you&#146;ve always wanted to have, one that is very
      special, or it could be a eulogy for a lost pet. We are all there
      to listen and learn and to share happiness and sorrow. We also
      need to discuss the TURTLERAMA which will be held on August 16.
      I will need you to sign up and let me know if you will be able
      to display your turtles, or have educational material for the
      public to view. I need lots of helpers as well, to keep the room
      as clean as possible and bring refreshments to the exhibitors.
      We&#146;ll have some of the exhibits outdoors as we did last
      year which gave us more room for indoor displays. Please pick
      up the Turtlerama flyers at the meeting to distribute around
      town or I can mail some to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What a horrible Spring we had
      to endure. Until the middle of May, the weather was cold, windy
      and rainy and one day a tornado warning was posted for good measure.
      Without any warm temperatures, tomatoes didn&#146;t grow and
      turtles began to get sick. Many of them came out of hibernation
      and because of the cold days and nights, they were not eating
      and the weaker ones perished. Russian tortoises, however, seemed
      to like the weather and I had several people report their Russians
      had laid eggs in February and March.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks to all who came to the
      Spring meeting. The day was very rainy and windy and I had my
      doubts as to whether or not anyone would show up &#150; and you
      didn&#146;t let me down. Father Dimitri gave a very informative
      presentation on nutrition and mating practices of various species.
      He also shared a recipe with us that I would like to share with
      all of you. Several times a year, serve your turtles and tortoises
      an omelet. Put 6 eggs, shells and all, into a blender and mix
      thoroughly, then fry the mixture on both sides and when cool,
      break off little pieces and serve it to your pets. They will
      all love it become healthier due to the fresh ingredients. Thanks,
      Dimitri, for helping us keep our turtles and tortoises in tip
      top condition. What would we do without you?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Use a &#145;mister&#146; in the
      outdoor enclosures for your box turtles, water turtles and tropical
      tortoises. Do not use it around desert tortoises, leopard tortoises,
      Russian tortoises or Sulcatas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you feed meat to your box
      and water turtles and you don&#146;t clean up the leftovers after
      dark, the predators will come and eat the leftovers and probably
      your turtles as well. BE ALERT!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For the first time, the residents
      of the Greenhouse remained inside until the end of May, four
      to six weeks longer than normal and it&#146;s never good for
      them to be imprisoned for 8 months. Everyone survived in spite
      of some gruesome events within the glass walls. I spoke about
      it at the April meeting and your fellow club members urged me
      to share these facts with you in the newsletter. I hope you have
      a barf bag handy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In winter, leopard tortoises
      have no access to grass in their diet and when they have a bowel
      movement, it is in the form of green diarrhea and a LOT of it.
      There is a smaller leopard tortoise in the greenhouse, around
      6 inches long. He likes to be with the bigger ones, he eats and
      sleeps close to them. One morning, as I did my &#145;rounds&#146;,
      (holding my nose, of course), I was concerned because I didn&#146;t
      see him anywhere. I reluctantly got down on my hands and knees
      to get a better look and I was sorry that I did. Behind the largest
      leopard tortoise was a suspicious mound of green poo, and completely
      enclosed in the green poo was Cooper, the small tortoise. I guess
      he was the victim of Blondie&#146;s explosive blast, which, if
      anyone remembers, happened once before when I took a Sulcata
      to Grand Court Assisted Living Facility. By the way, they recently
      renamed and remodeled the facility. I feel somehow responsible.
      Little Cooper was cleaned up but never did learn from his smelly
      experience.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">State Scientists Day was bright
      and sunny and I brought 2 desert tortoise hatchlings to the event
      at the State Capitol in a secure cage which was a good idea since
      approximately 1500 school children came to the event to learn
      what air pollution is doing to our planet. My table was set up
      between a guy cutting up many rainbow trout to show how to discard
      the innards and a display of healthy and diseased pig lungs,
      which the folks were inflating and deflating. I must say it was
      a disgusting couple of hours but it was fun talking to the children
      about tortoises.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It happened again! A lovely couple&#146;s
      daughter was having her 9th birthday and since they were about
      to go on a vacation and their daughter wanted a box turtle for
      her birthday, I asked them to come over and pick one out and
      I would save it until they returned. The people were so excited
      and happy. When they arrived, I escorted the family to the back
      yard and they were amazed by all of the tortoises and turtles
      they saw. We approached the box turtle habitat and I noticed
      some commotion going on in the water turtle pond. I stared in
      disbelief at the scene before me. These things NEVER happen when
      I am alone at The Bunker. There were two box turtles in the pond
      and they were joined together at the tail, which you would expect
      to see if the pair was mating. I whispered to the mom that her
      daughter might be getting more of an education than she wanted.
      I reached down to take them out of the water and it was then
      that I noticed (and I&#146;m only telling you, my readers) that
      the turtles joined together were two males. I placed them elsewhere
      and quickly went back to finding the perfect birthday turtle
      for a little girl hoping nobody noticed my red face.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I recently bought a few of the
      coiled hoses to make the yard appear neater. It was a huge mistake.
      It didn&#146;t take long before the tortoises were climbing all
      over it, tumbling upside down, walking around with the hose coiled
      around their bodies and generally being tangled up in it, and
      trapped in the sunshine. Yikes&#133;.don&#146;t use them!</FONT></P>
