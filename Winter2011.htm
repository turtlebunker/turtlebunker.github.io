      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Members and Friends:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our <B>Winter</B> meeting
      will be held on <B>January 21 from 1:30 until 4</B> at the Belle
      Cooledge Library, 5600 South Land Park Drive, 95822. If the weather
      is foggy or very rainy we will cancel the meeting so please call
      me if you are unsure. We'll discuss the problems you may have
      had during the year and how you plan on making life better for
      your turtles and tortoises in 2012. I'm going to try to landscape
      a little and build a 'maternity hill'.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our Fall meeting did not go off
      as expected. Pretty much 'Murphy's Law' was in effect and anything
      that could go wrong did go wrong. The main reason was the renovation
      going on outside of the meeting room. We could not use the door
      and had to walk around to the front entrance to the library and
      enter that way which was a bit inconvenient for most of us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I arrived with my station wagon
      packed with 'stuff' for the meeting. There were boxes of sale
      table items, raffle prizes, plastic pools, aquariums to give
      away, lots and lots of plants to donate and a bunch of water
      plants to talk about. I barely had room to sit behind the steering
      wheel. I didn't see anyone out front so I waited and waited unable
      to leave the car since the sunshine was directly on the THIRTEEN
      turtles and plants inside the car by the back window. There were
      some teenage boys on skateboards speeding about as well. It didn't
      seem wise to leave the car unattended.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mary Sue finally came out and
      I enlisted her help and one or two other people showed up to
      help while everyone was seated inside wondering where I was..........anyway,
      we wrestled the pool out of the car and filled it with water
      and the turtles for adoption. We got the plants out and people
      began taking them and, unfortunately, the water plants I had
      brought for a presentation, were taken as well.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But it didn't matter because
      our meeting room was packed with a lot of new faces, our new
      Facebook friends, and lots of them kept me very busy signing
      them up as new members. I was standing in a corner the entire
      time with the paperwork sliding down onto the box turtles up
      for adoption. There was no way to have a 'meeting' but everyone
      seemed to enjoy being together and chatting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When I first came into the room,
      I noticed everyone was eating. Dimitri was very busy in his little
      corner doing pre-hibernation checkups (thanks a bunch for your
      hard work, sorry I couldn't get there to give you a drink!) We
      did have the raffle and eventually the crowd thinned out. I had
      not seen any of the food that you brought except for Jeanette
      frying the lumpia in the kitchen the whole time. After cleaning
      up the room, Maria Lambert came up to me with a small blue paper
      plate containing some dried up old cold rice and something else
      shriveled and she looked me in the eye with so much sadness and
      quietly said, &quot;THERE ARE NO FORKS LEFT!!!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">WINTER NOTES: </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hibernation time gives us the time to
      reflect on how our pets did last season and how to improve things
      for the coming year. By the time we have our meeting, we'll only
      be 4 weeks away from the turtles starting to wake up in this
      area. Be alert starting around Valentine's Day. Also, if we have
      a good rain, you might find hatchlings (turtles AND tortoises)
      coming up out of the ground that you had no clue were even there.
      Watch where you walk!!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your tortoises are asleep
      in a box in the garage or in a closet, every so often listen
      for noises. If they become restless, something might be wrong.
      If it continues, you could take the tortoise out of the box,
      give him a little soak, dry him off thoroughly and then return
      him to the box. If an outdoor tortoise or box turtle is ill,
      they often will come out and sit out all day and night. Even
      the ones you don't want to hibernate and have indoors may not
      want to eat, etc. and it is ok to turn off the lights and let
      them get cooler and sleep from now until about Valentine's Day
      when you will notice them coming back to life.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All seems ok so far after a devastating
      summer of murder and mayhem in the back yard due to a vicious
      raccoon. We suspect it was a female living in a neighbors attic
      with a baby. Once Ray finally got them out of his attic, there
      was no more trouble. But prior to that, nobody was getting much
      sleep around here.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The nights lately have been in
      the low 20's but it hasn't stopped Just Jim Jr or Jim the Jerk
      (Greeks) and the new residents, &quot;Ma and Pa&quot; (Hermann's
      tortoises) from coming out to bask in the weak sunshine from
      perhaps 10:30 am until 1:30 pm when the shade returns to their
      enclosure. A few box turtles join them as well. I no longer try
      to understand but just make sure they are under cover for the
      night. Even the baby sliders are swimming about after being frozen
      overnight. It's just amazing. I hope our plants survive as well
      as they do.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Lately, Blondie has been trying
      to get out of the greenhouse. She will stand on her hind legs
      and with her front paws push on the door. If I am not careful
      to 'latch' it closed, she will open it and come out and freeze
      to death. I have a feeling she wants to dig a nest again. Everyone
      else is quiet for now. Feeding them is a problem because thousands
      of ants are ready to swarm on any food that is in any way wet
      such as bananas or those red fruits from the cactus which the
      tortoises love so much. I really try to avoid problems here but
      there is always some annoyance going on outside!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There aren't too many turtles
      in my house for the winter. (Famous last words??) Just a few
      victims of the raccoon who are missing their feet (but surviving
      well) and Fong and Fong the Asian or Chinese box turtles who
      hatched about 6 weeks ago. They love to eat which is great. They
      were joined by a baby slider last week who was brought here by
      club member, Patty. The turtle was given to her 84 year old mother,
      yes, in the little plastic container with a palm tree. Many of
      the pet shops still get away with selling hundreds of these sliders.
      Not much we can do except to try to keep some of them alive.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On another topic, our <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=299507146787&ref=ts">FACEBOOK</A>
      page is one of the best things we have as a club. There are almost
      300 good people chatting back and forth all day, every day, and
      it's a great way to have your questions answered immediately
      and if someone does not agree, you will certainly hear about
      it. It's sort of addicting! You'll find yourself checking in
      quite often, especially if there is a controversy as there was
      over the raccoon and how to deal with it. WOW. There were plenty
      of heated arguments.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'd like to say to the Facebook
      friends who joined up at the last meeting, here's how the gatherings
      usually work. These are not 'formal' meetings. There are no minutes
      read, nobody is elected to anything, but we are there to enjoy
      each other and learn a little or a lot. We try to have a little
      'talk' about seasonal problems between 1:30 and 3 including questions
      and answers and also have Show and Tell (if anyone has brought
      their pet to talk about) and anyone is welcome to give a presentation.
      At 3, we have MUNCH AND MINGLE and while we are eating, we start
      the raffle which can last up to an hour and is a lot of fun.
      Then, for those who choose to stay longer, there is more turtle
      talk and also we have to clean up the meeting room and put all
      of the chairs and tables back where they belong. Many thanks
      for those who stay to help, it is appreciated.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In addition, thanks to every
      one of you for your continued support including lots of dues
      'plus' which totally keeps the club going and going and going.
      I couldn't do it without you!! You are all so terrific. (Loved
      all of the Christmas cards too!!)</FONT></P>
